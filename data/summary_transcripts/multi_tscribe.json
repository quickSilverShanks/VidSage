    "smry_text": "### Crash Course Philosophy Summary\n\nThis episode kicks off a journey into the core questions about our existence and our understanding of the world. \n\n**Philosophy at its Core:**  Hank Green's crash course explores philosophical inquiry, tracing roots back to ancient Greece where philosophers sought to understand the \"what\" and \"why\" of everything \u2013 from the nature of reality itself to our own identities in a larger world. The video uses historical context from ancient Greece (Plato\u2019s Academy and Aristotle\u2019s Lyceum) for example, demonstrating how early philosophers' ideas were both analytical and scientific, but also marked as 'wisdom.\" \n\n**Big Questions:** What's the nature of reality? Is there something beyond matter and energy?  These questions are central to metaphysics: the exploration of fundamental world elements like existence. Further thought prompts further philosophical explorations such as questions about the existence of God. How do our inner natures and souls relate to the physical world and what happens after death are all points the show explores.\n\n**Epistemology:** Alongside these deeper inquiries, there is also examination of how we come to know anything at all - epistemology \u2013 the study of knowledge itself.  The video asks questions about ourselves.  How do our \"perceptions\" of the world impact what we truly believe it is? \n \nThis Crash Course explores philosophical concepts while considering: Why this journey matters; the use of pop culture and storytelling to illustrate complex ideas using a variety of examples \u2013 from Batman and The Matrix and the history of philosophy through time.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "smry_text": "Philosophical inquiry examines fundamental questions regarding existence's nature and human understanding.  Ancient Greece witnessed a prominent philosophical movement, with scholars like Plato and Aristotle emphasizing \"philosophia\" as the study of everything, encompassing both scientific exploration and reasoned discourse.\n\nPhilosophers investigate the world's characteristics in various forms. One example is metaphysical analysis, which seeks to understand reality's fundamental nature beyond physicality and existence's ultimate origins (like a divine creator). Questions emerge about the self's essence\u2014whether or not there exists an immaterial soul\u2014 and how individual beings relate to a larger universe.  These lead philosophers into a deep exploration of metaphysics' field, examining the universe and our place within it.\n\nEpistemology, the study of knowledge, further considers questions like \"Is the world accurately perceived?\" and offers various interpretations on achieving truth and authenticity in thought. It challenges if certain methodologies may prove better than others for gaining knowledge.\n\nEthics branches into value theory by analyzing an individual's moral compass and their choices in life\u2014a core aspect of how individuals live that is influenced by beliefs about right and wrong. This philosophical inquiry examines ethical frameworks, challenging the traditional notion of ethics as merely a binary opposition of \"good\" or \"bad.\" \n",

    "smry_text": "Philosophy's historical roots trace back to the ancient Greek world, where scholars distinguished between \"philos,\" signifying science and logic, and \"mythos,\" encompassing storytelling. These early thinkers utilized a systematic approach to exploring the world, incorporating both analytical methods (which pre-dated modern science)  and questioning established knowledge in pursuit of answers. \n\n**The Philosophical Landscape**\n\n* During this era, questions regarding reality emerged: Was the world merely composed of matter and energy, or was there something else at work? This fundamental inquiry delved into existential concerns, prompting discussions about God's existence, his properties and role within the universe.  Beyond \"what is the world like?\" philosophers grappled with questions about individuality and self-identity, exploring concepts such as a soul and its longevity after death. \nThese inquiries constituted metaphysics - one of three fundamental branches of philosophy that explored the underlying fabric of existence itself.\n\n* Epistemology then came into play. Its purpose aimed at elucidating how we acquire knowledge and understanding. Questions like: \"Is this reality accurate or merely subjective?\", as well as exploring alternative paths to truth beyond science, formed a core part of this field. \n \n **Values in Action**   \n\nEthical philosophy (a branch within Value Theory) examined how individuals should live in accordance with societal norms and moral principles. For instance: 'Are there reasons why we ought to treat strangers differently than those we love?' Examining questions of obligation, altruism, environmental responsibility, sparked discussion within the field. \n\n  \n **The Aesthetics Dimension**   \n Aestheticians delved into the concept of beauty. Their study revolved around defining and establishing criteria for evaluation in the realm of the aesthetic. Through art, media, or personal reflection -- they contemplated the phenomenon and its significance, questioning whether beauty even exists independently of our own perception.\n\n\n\nThis provided a condensed synopsis from the provided transcript focusing on clarity, consistency and accuracy by removing extraneous words and phrases used during delivery and emphasizing the objective summary of information within.\n",
    "clean_text": "Nowadays, people use the word \"philosophy\" to describe an opinion or approach to a certain topic.  For example, you might have a \"philosophy\" when it comes to golf. While I don't personally have one.  We will use this word more narrowly to describe a way of approaching the world that traces its roots back to ancient Greece, 500 years before the Common Era. This was a time of great intellectual movement around the world. At that time, Buddhism and Jainism were developing in Asia while philosophical thought emerged in Greece. There, scholars were entangled in a distinction they were just beginning to make - between philos and mythos \u2013 or what we would now roughly call science and storytelling.  At this time, bards like Homer were trying to understand and explain the world through stories; meanwhile, the earliest philosophers used more analytical and scientific methods\u2014 although they didn\u2019t have the concept of \"science\" at that time. So philosophia \u2013 literally, \"the love of wisdom\" - was a new way of trying to make sense of the world.  When the earliest philosophers used the word \"philosophy,\" they basically meant, \"the academic study of anything.\" Which might, for instance, include golf. However, at the first universities in the western world \u2013 Plato's Academy and Aristotle\u2019s Lyceum \u2013 math, biology, physics, poetry, political science, and astronomy were all considered to be philosophy. Afterward, scholars began thinking about these fields differently -  As separate disciplines. Studies with strong empirical elements became considered science - a search for answers. But philosophy came to be understood more as a way of thinking about questions. Big Questions. And today, 25 hundred years after the ancient Greeks first brought them up, Philosophers still love to ask questions\u2014and they don't mind that they may never get an answer.  So, what are these big questions that have managed to intrigue and stump philosophers for so long? One could perhaps best be phrased as: What is the world like? This seems simple enough \u2013 just look around! And see all of it, right?  Well\u2026this is how the world looks. But philosophical approaches aren\u2019t based solely on observation - they have much more complex questions hidden inside. For example, when a philosopher wonders what the world is like; she might really be asking: What's the nature of reality? For instance, is the world just matter and energy or something else entirely? And there are endless possibilities\u2026But that\u2019s for another time! Then, how can an individual find out what exactly constitutes this kind of reality? What constitutes truth then if truth has many facets \u2013 and more to it than the simple perception we have in our limited minds. \n\nHow does one start to understand or seek for the answer to such questions? And that is where ethics, aesthetics, and so much more come into play... \n\n\n\n  Now\u2026on with our journey:\n\n\n**Ethics:*\n* This is related, though!  What do you want? How will this help me become a better person? \n\nThink about it! It's a question many philosophers ask themselves. How do we live, treat others? We can be kind and understanding or cruel and callous\u2026It's all up to each individual, right?\n\n **Value Theory:*\n* In this area of philosophy, there are two main categories. Ethics isn\u2019t just about right or wrong; in fact, this branch is more focused on the \"how\" of living\u2014what is good for someone can be something different for someone else\u2026so how do we live in a harmonious relationship with each other and with nature?\n\n  **Aesthetics:** (And Art) \n* This branch of philosophy studies beauty. What's beautiful, at least from a philosophical standpoint: How do we define it\u2026and what makes it truly \"Beautiful\u201d? \n\n\n\n   It\u2019s important to note - the pursuit of aestheticians\u2014who study this special type of thought\u2014believes there is something universally \u201cbeautiful,\u201d something that transcends time and individual perception\n",

    "smry_text": "Historical Development of Philosophy\n\nPhilosophers often approached problems in their fields with different perspectives than they do today, where scientific inquiry is a central aspect of how people understand the world. The concept of science began to separate disciplines from philosophy and as time went on it became about empirical observation.  Modern academics started asking: \"How can we approach these questions?\"\n\nThe History of Questions in Philosophy\n\n\nOne early philosophical question explored in ancient Greece was \u201cWhat is the nature of reality?\u201d. This question has implications for what constitutes physical existence, a core topic in metaphysics \u2013 one branch of philosophy that focuses on understanding fundamental truth and knowledge of being. The study of how knowledge originates (epistemology) adds another layer to this inquiry. Philosophy also explores if the world as we perceive it is an accurate representation.  Another major question asked concerns how true knowledge is acquired (is science truly a reliable means). What does Truth consist in? \n\nUnderstanding Our Place and Morality\nValue theory investigates a broader category - questions about what constitutes good or bad, right or wrong, beauty, etc., exploring philosophical concepts of ethics - which explores the human condition and societal behavior.  The branch of Value Theory that deals with aesthetics explores how a definition of Beauty is derived via an analysis of art as well as media representations of beauty.  Finally, there is Logic. \n\nConclusion\nPhilosophers' explorations may provide answers to seemingly trivial situations, like deciding whether to eat a salad or, hypothetically, dating. It is crucial to understand why philosophers ponder these questions as they are in some way connected to how we live our lives and our place in the world.   Their inquiry provides frameworks to analyze and solve seemingly basic daily problem that are not merely confined to academic spheres. \n",

Because: Only when you challenge your\nunderstanding of how some people view the world, can you decide for yourself if theirs\nis a view worth having.

Success, in this course, will mean that you\nknow how to think.",
    "smry_text": "Philosophical Inquiry \n\nThis exploration begins the process of understanding fundamental questions about existence: Does our world comprise solely matter and energy?  Are there external influences or forces at play? How about spirituality; does a god exist, if so, what is its nature? These inquiries are part of metaphysical philosophy, a branch exploring the foundational reality of the universe and being. \n\nEpistemology, another significant area within the philosophical landscape, addresses how we gain knowledge and test the validity of our beliefs. Is there real truth in the world as we perceive it? This leads to questions about the nature of objectivity versus intuition or perception, especially when considering the diverse views that may exist in society. \n\nValue Theory further delves into ethical behavior.  It examines human roles and obligations, exploring whether certain principles should guide our life choices\u2014like altruism and ethical action in daily interactions with others (family vs. strangers). The concept of ethics is linked to Value Theory, examining our motivations when weighing choices. Aesthetics, a branch within Value Theory, investigates the nature of beauty itself, studying art and their objective qualities. \n\nFinally, Logic offers a framework for analyzing philosophical arguments, providing tools to identify fallacies\u2014obstacles to achieving clear logical judgments in this field.\n \nThe pursuit of knowledge can be applied to daily life without formal study. From deciding on everyday choices or debates at home, people are making philosophical decisions every day. The course will provide critical thought about the world by examining different philosophies and their corresponding values while challenging preconceived notions. A final point emphasizes that the objective is not just acquiring a body of knowledge but rather developing sound reasoning skills through discussion and analysis.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to remember, true success in philosophy lies in developing critical thinking and questioning as opposed to simply relying on pre-established ideas or beliefs about the world.\n",

Now, at this point I wouldn\u2019t blame you\nif you\u2019re thinking: \u201cAm I real?\u201d \u201cDo I...do I know anything?\u201d Well, as questions go,\nthese might not seem super\u2026practical. But there\u2019s another area of philosophy that\nhelps frame your thinking around what you actually do -- like, how you should act, and\nwhat you should attach meaning to. It\u2019s called Value Theory. And it\u2019s usually divided\ninto two main branches. The first is Ethics. You\u2019ve heard of it -- it\u2019s the thing that\npoliticians are always said to lack? And Jedi are supposed to have in great supply?\nThough, don\u2019t get me started on the prequels. In philosophy, though, ethics isn\u2019t just\na code of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s the study of how humans should live\nwith each other. Rather than just sitting around and judging people,\nethics involves posing questions like: How should I live? Is there any reason that I should treat, say,\nstrangers differently than the people I love? And for that matter, do I owe anything to\nmyself? What about animals? Or the earth? And if I do have any of these obligations\nat all, where do they come from? Who says? Ultimately, whatever system you use to decide\nwhat\u2019s good or evil, as human behavior goes, is determined by your values -- that\u2019s why\nethics is considered part of Value Theory. But the other part of value theory isn\u2019t\nabout what\u2019s right -- it\u2019s about what\u2019s beautiful. Aesthetics is the study of beauty, and art. Now, the concept of beauty is talked about practically\neverywhere, from the media, to art school to barber college. But for philosophers, the pursuit of aesthetics involves\nconsidering what beauty is, and whether it even exists. Aesthetics is a part of value theory, because\nbeauty, and art, are things we value, and evaluate. And many people who study this particular\nkind of philosophy -- known as aestheticians -- believe there is such as thing as The Beautiful\n-- something that doesn\u2019t depend on what you happen to find attractive, but something\nthat\u2019s just objectively true. And finally, there\u2019s one more aspect of\nphilosophy that I should mention, because it doesn\u2019t ask questions, so much as help us\nfind answers. Yes, finally, some answers! And that thing, which I happen to think can\nbe beautiful in its own way, is logic. Logic is the philosopher\u2019s toolbox. It contains\nthe saws and hammers, the microscopes and beakers, that philosophers use to go about\nanswering their questions in a clear, systematic way. Logic is about reasoning, giving strong arguments\nthat don\u2019t fall victim to fallacies, which are, as you\u2019ll learn, the mortal enemies\nof philosophical precision. Ok, so metaphysics, epistemology, value theory\n-- they might all seem pretty airy and abstract. But don\u2019t worry, because you have already done\nphilosophy, even though you might not realize it. You do it in almost every aspect of your life. Every time you argue with your parents, or\nwonder if you should date someone, or decide to eat a salad instead of a ham \u2018n\u2019 cheese\nHot Pocket, you are doing philosophy. Because you\u2019re thinking about the world,\nand your place in it. You\u2019re figuring out what you value, why you value it, and what\nyou should do about it. So here\u2019s our plan. We\u2019re going to learn\nabout the major fields of philosophy, posing questions and considering possible answers along\nthe way. And each time, we will use a two-step method. First, we\u2019ll really try to understand. You\u2019re not going to agree with all of the\nideas that I present to you \u2013 and I won\u2019t agree with them either! That\u2019s not the point.\nThe point, in step one, is to really try to get inside of an idea \u2013 to understand it\nas charitably as possible. Then, in step two, you\u2019ll subject your understanding\nto some serious critical evaluation \u2013 basically, you\u2019ll try to knock down what you think\nyou know about a particular view of the world. And you\u2019ll do this whether you agree with\nthe view or not. Why? Because: Only when you challenge your\nunderstanding of how some people view the world, can you decide for yourself if theirs\nis a view worth having. Which leads me to my final point: Philosophy\nis not your usual field of study. I\u2019m not going to be teaching you a body of knowledge\nwhere success means you know a bunch of stuff. Success, in this course, will mean that you\nknow how to think. All we have are questions. And all you have\nis a brain. And the goal of philosophy is for you to use your brain to come up with\nthe answers that make the most sense to you. You\u2019ll learn how to formulate arguments to support your\nideas, so you can explain why you think you\u2019re right. Which, if you\u2019ve ever been on the Internet, you\nknow is something that not a lot of people are good at. In order to do that, you\u2019re going to need\nto understand philosophical reasoning \u2013 the tools we use to investigate life\u2019s most\nperplexing questions! And that is where we\u2019re gonna be headed the next time we meet. For now you\u2019ve learned about the historical\norigins of philosophy in ancient Greece, and its three main divisions: metaphysics, epistemology,\nand value theory. We also talked about logic, and how you\u2019re going to use it to understand and\ncritically evaluate a whole host of different worldviews. But not about golf.

    "smry_text": "Philosophical Inquiry\n\nThis video outlines key insights from the field of philosophy, exploring concepts related to truth and its pursuit. The speaker emphasizes the importance of seeking answers to fundamental questions about reality:\n\n* **Truth & Methodology:** The first question is whether or not we can ever truly know the existence of a universally true 'truth.' \n    *  The video explores alternative paths to attain knowledge, comparing them to traditional scientific methods and speculating on their limitations. It hints at the possibility that more ethereal understanding might offer an alternative to scientific analysis. \n* **Value Theory:** This branch of philosophy dives into issues such as ethics, aesthetics, and practical choices in daily life, arguing for a connection between personal values and worldview.  The video explores two main branches of value theory: Ethics, focusing on right and wrong (what humanity should do), and Aesthetics, concerning beauty and art's value within this. \n* **Logic:** A cornerstone of philosophical inquiry is logical reasoning through investigation into the world's complexities and its underlying workings. It emphasizes the role of argumentative skills in determining validity and understanding different perspectives.  \n    * The speaker suggests that philosophy should not be about acquiring knowledge but understanding a broad spectrum of philosophical possibilities, pushing viewers to actively engage in critical evaluation. \n\n\nUltimately, the video presents an exploration of the foundational principles of thinking through key disciplines as well as engaging with core questions regarding truth and our place within the world order.\n",

    "smry_text": "### Philosophy: A Study of Values & Concepts\n\nThis video explores the foundational concepts within philosophy, including its connection to ethics, aesthetics, and logic.  It explains that studying these principles doesn't solely involve accepting pre-defined rules or beliefs; it encourages questioning existing views and forming unique reasoning based on a foundation of critical evaluation. \n\n**Ethics:** Philosophy delves into how human beings should interact with each other and themselves, including questions about duty, obligations (towards others, animals, the environment),  and personal well-being.  Ethical theories address these questions by considering values and exploring concepts such as utilitarianism and deontology.\n\n **Value Theory & Aesthetics**: A central part of philosophy is understanding what aspects of life hold value and why. This framework connects to aesthetics, a field devoted to beauty and artistic expression itself. It explores whether 'the Beautiful' exists objectively, and its purpose within various philosophical systems.  \n\n**Logic: The Tool for Answering Philosophical Queries**\n Logic provides the framework for formulating arguments that are grounded in reasoning rather than relying solely on emotion or prejudice. It helps philosophers approach questions in a systematic way and develop strong, persuasive arguments. \n\n **The \"A-Ha\" Moments - Real World Application of Philosophy:** Philosophers engage with these principles not just within academia but in daily life. They ponder issues from personal decisions such as dating to moral dilemmas through critical analysis. This video highlights how philosophy plays upon questions that arise in real life, guiding individuals towards  answers unique to their understanding. \n**Philosophy: A Quest for Understanding and Meaning:** This course emphasizes the importance of learning through philosophical inquiry, exploring various viewpoints and perspectives rather than being a body of fixed or unchanging knowledge. It equips students with critical thinking strategies and analytical skills within different areas of thought and life. The ultimate goal is to understand how to answer complex questions by constructing solid reasoning and forming opinions.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:** This Crash Course episode was made possible thanks to Squarespace for providing technical support, and PBS Digital Studios for facilitating its production in cooperation with the Crash Course brand. \n\n\n",

    "text": " Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you\nby Squarespace. Squarespace: share your passion with the world. Aristotle once described humans as \u201cthe\nrational animal.\u201d Well, actually, he said that \u201cman is the\nrational animal,\u201d but we don\u2019t have to be sexist just because he was. And if you\u2019ve ever gotten into an argument\nwith someone about religion or politics or which Hemsworth is the hottest, then you\u2019ve experienced\nhow irrational people can be about their opinions. But what Aristotle meant is that rationality\nis our distinguishing characteristic \u2013 it\u2019s what sets us apart from the beasts. And no matter how much you disagree with someone\nabout God or Obama or Chris Hemsworth, you can at least grant that they are not beasts. Because, most of the time at least, people\ncan be persuaded. By arguments. You use arguments all the time -- in the comments,\nat family dinners, with your friends -- you probably just don\u2019t think of them the same\nway that philosophers do. When you try and convince your parents to\nloan you the car, or when you\u2019re talking up Crash Course to your friends, you are using\narguments. Thanks, by the way. Each time you tell someone to do or believe\nsomething -- or when you\u2019re explaining why you do or believe something -- you are giving\nan argument. The problem is, the vast majority of people\naren\u2019t really good at arguments. We tend to confuse making a good argument\nwith, like, having witty comebacks, or just making your points more loudly and angrily,\ninstead of building a case on a solid foundation of logic. Which can be harder than it sounds. But learning about arguments and strong reasoning\nwill not only make you a better philosopher, it will also set you up to be a more persuasive\nperson. Someone who people will listen to. Someone who\u2019s convincing. So, yeah, these skills are beneficial no matter\nwhat you want to do with your life. So you might as well know how to argue properly. [Theme Music] If you want to learn how to argue, then you\nshould probably start about 2400 years ago, when Plato was laying out how reason can,\nand should, function in the human mind. He believed that we all have what he called\na tripartite soul \u2013 what you might think of as your \u201cself,\u201d or your psyche, divided\ninto three parts. First, there\u2019s the rational, or logical\npart of the soul, which represents cool reason. This is the aspect of your self that seeks\nthe truth and is swayed by facts and arguments. When you decide to stop eating bacon for two\nmeals a day because, as delicious as it is, it\u2019s bad for you, then you make that decision\nwith the guidance of the rational part of your soul. But then there\u2019s the spirited aspect, often\ndescribed as the emotional part of the self, although that doesn\u2019t really quite capture\nit. The spirited soul isn\u2019t just about feeling\n-- it\u2019s also about how your feelings fuel your actions. It\u2019s the part that responds in righteous\nanger at injustice, the part that drives your ambition, and calls upon you to protect others. It gives you a sense of honor and duty, and\nis swayed by sympathy. So if you decide to stop eating bacon because\nyou just finished reading Charlotte\u2019s Web, and now you\u2019re in love with Wilbur, then\nyou\u2019re being guided by the spirited part of your soul. But we share the next part of our soul with\nother animals, be they pig, or moose, or aardvark. The appetitive part is what drives you to\neat, have sex, and protect yourself from danger. It is swayed by temptations that are carnal,\nand visceral. So at those times when you go ahead and just\nEAT ALL THE BACON because it just smells so dang good, the appetitive aspect of your soul\nis in control. Now, Plato believed that the best human beings\n-- and I should point out here that Plato most definitely did believe that some people\nwere better than others -- are always ruled by the rational part of their soul, because it works\nto keep the spirited and the appetitive parts in check. People who allow themselves to be ruled by\ntheir spirited or appetitive selves are base, he believed, and not fully, properly human. Now, most of us don\u2019t buy into the concept\nof the tripartite soul anymore -- or the idea that some humans are less human than others. But we do understand that we\u2019re all motivated by\nphysical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments. And philosophers continue to agree with Plato\nthat reason should be in the driver\u2019s seat. So, how do you know if you\u2019re good at it?\nHow can you test your reasoning? Well, let\u2019s head over to the Thought Bubble\nfor some Flash Philosophy. Throughout this course, we\u2019re going to apply our\nphilosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments. Because remember: Philosophers love thinking about\nquestions -- especially ones that don\u2019t have ready answers. So think of these exercises as philosophical\nwind-sprints -- quick tests of your mental abilities. And here\u2019s a doozy, from 20th century British\nthinker Bertrand Russell, one of the pioneers of what\u2019s known as analytic philosophy. Say there\u2019s a town in which all men are\nrequired by law to be clean-shaven. This town has only one barber, a man, who must follow\nstrict rules: Rule number one: He must shave all men who\ndo not shave themselves. Rule number two: He must not shave any man\nwho does shave himself. It\u2019s the nightmare of every libertarian and every\nmustachio\u2019d hipster. But here\u2019s the question: Does the barber shave himself? Cause think about it: The barber only shaves\nmen who don\u2019t shave themselves. So if he does shave himself, then he must not, because the barber\u2019s\nnot allowed to shave guys who shave themselves. But, if he doesn\u2019t shave himself, then he has\nto be shaved by the barber, because that\u2019s the law. Russell came up with this puzzle to illustrate the\nfact that a group must always be a member of itself. That means, in this case, that \u201call men\nwho shave themselves\u201d has to include every guy who shaves himself, including the barber. Otherwise, the logic that dictates the group\u2019s\nexistence just doesn\u2019t hold up.",
    "smry_text": "### Aristotle's Concept of Human Rationality\n\nThis video explores the concept of human rationality as described by philosopher Aristotle. He argued that humans are the rational animal, distinguishing them from animals in their ability to reason and engage in logical discussions. \n\nHumans possess a \"rational\" part within ourselves, driven by logic, facts, and arguments. This aspect guides decisions like choosing healthy food.  \n\nThe video explains further that our soul consists of three parts:\n  * **Rational:** This part strives for truth through logic and evidence-based reasoning, guiding decision-making based on facts.\n  * **Spiritually Motivated:** This encompasses passion, empathy, emotions driving actions like standing up for justice or exhibiting ambition. \n  * **Appetite/Survival:** This governs desires like eating, having sexual relationships and protecting ourselves from harm influenced by our physical needs and temptations.\n\n While modern thinking diverges from the concept of a strict three-part soul (the term was a philosophical idea), we still understand that humans are driven by physical desires, emotional impulses and rational arguments as these elements play a role in how we act. \n\n\n### The Importance of Reasoning Skills\n\nThe video emphasizes why practicing argumentation is essential beyond just debating with friends.  Reasoning skills are valuable tools for:\n   *  Effective communication and persuasion\n   *  Deepened knowledge and understanding\n\nThrough various philosophical exercises, including thought experiments like Bertrand Russell\u2019s Barber Paradox, participants will test their reasoning abilities \u2013 sharpening them in the process. \n\nIn conclusion, the video stresses that reasoning plays a central role in human life and its effectiveness in achieving success can be seen through studying Plato's theories of the soul where the rational part is deemed to be superior in guiding behaviour.   \n   \n\n\n\n",
    "clean_text": "\"Crash Course Philosophy\" is brought to you by Squarespace. Squarespace: share your passion with the world. Aristotle once described humans as \u201cthe rational animal.\u201d Well, actually, he said that \u201cman is the rational animal,\u201d but we don't have to be sexist just because he was. And if you\u2019ve ever gotten into an argument with someone about religion or politics or which Hemsworth is the hottest, then you\u2019ve experienced how irrational people can be about their opinions. But what Aristotle meant is that rationality is our distinguishing characteristic \u2013 it\u2019s what sets us apart from the beasts. And no matter how much you disagree with someone about God or Obama or Chris Hemsworth, you can at least grant that they are not beasts. Because, most of the time at least, people can be persuaded by arguments. You use arguments all the time \u2014 in the comments, at family dinners, with your friends \u2014 you probably just don\u2019t think of them the same way philosophers do. When you try and convince your parents to loan you the car, or when you're talking up Crash Course to your friends, you are using arguments. Thanks, by the way. Each time you tell someone to do or believe something \u2014 or when you're explaining why you do or believe something \u2014 you are giving an argument. The problem is, the vast majority of people aren\u2019t really good at arguments. We tend to confuse making a good argument with simply having witty comebacks or just making your points more loudly and angrily instead of building a case on a solid foundation of logic. Which can be harder than it sounds. But learning about arguments and strong reasoning will not only make you a better philosopher, it will also set you up to be a more persuasive person. Someone who people will listen to. Someone who's convincing. So, yeah, these skills are beneficial no matter what you want to do with your life. So you might as well know how to argue properly. [Theme Music] If you want to learn how to argue, then you should probably start about 2400 years ago, when Plato was laying out how reason can, and should, function in the human mind. He believed that we all have what he called a tripartite soul \u2013 what you might think of as your \u201cself,\u201d or your psyche, divided into three parts. First, there\u2019s the rational, or logical part of the soul, which represents cool reason. This is the aspect of your self that seeks the truth and is swayed by facts and arguments. When you decide to hire based on resume alone versus actually going out to talk to candidates directly is a much harder conversation, and a deeper one if that makes sense\n \nLet's move now to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy. Throughout this course, we\u2019re going to apply our philosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments. Because remember: Philosophers love thinking about questions\u2014especially ones that don\u2019t have ready answers. So, think of these exercises as philosophical wind sprints \u2013 quick tests of your mental abilities. And here's a doozy from 20th-century British thinker Bertrand Russell, one of the pioneers of what\u2019s known as analytic philosophy. Say there\u2019s a town in which all men are required by law to be clean-shaven. This town has only one barber, a man, who must follow strict rules: Rule number one: He must shave all men who do not shave themselves. Rule number two: He must not shave any man who does shave himself. It's the nightmare of every libertarian and every mustachioed hipster. But here\u2019s the question: Does the barber shave himself?  Here\u2019s why you need to think about this: If he shaves himself, then he should be able to, based on rule number one, shave only those who do not shave themselves - according to rule number two, he can't and must not in an act of logic. But if the barber does not shave himself, then he would meet the requirement by rule number one of shaving only those not shaving themselves, as stated by rule number two.  But that logic also leads us to a position where all men must also be clean shaved as per these rules; The argument here is this: That makes it much more difficult to understand what constitutes the barber's responsiblity when considering all the people he needs to shave. As such, the only reason for the barber being able to cut his hair at all, is if those around him don\u2019t have time or ability to shave themselves, which would then make this a purely logistical task rather than something requiring physical action and therefore rule-breaking.\n\n\n\n",

Otherwise, the logic that dictates the group\u2019s\nexistence just doesn\u2019t hold up.

So, how do we make sure that we\u2019re ruled\nby good, sound, not-flawed reason? By perfecting the art of the argument. An argument, in philosophy, isn\u2019t just a\nshouting match. Instead, philosophers maintain that your beliefs\nshould always be backed up by reasons, which we call premises. Premises form the structure of your argument.\nThey offer evidence for your belief, and you can have as many premises as you like, as\nlong as they support your conclusion, which is the thing that you actually believe. So, let\u2019s dissect the anatomy of an argument. There are actually several different species\nof arguments. Probably the most familiar, and the easiest to carry out, is the deductive\nargument. The main rule of a deductive arguments is: if your\npremises are true, then your conclusion must be true. And knowing that something is actually true\nis very rare, and awesome.

As you might have noticed, there are plenty\nof mortal humans who never taught Plato. What\u2019s interesting, though, is that this\nargument does happen to have a true conclusion, which leads us to another issue. And that\nis: Validity is not the same as truth. All \u2018valid\u2019 really means is that if the premises\nare true, then your conclusion can\u2019t be false. But that doesn\u2019t mean that your\npremises prove your conclusion to be correct.",
    "smry_text": "### The Tripartite Soul and Ethical Reasoning:\n\nThis transcript explores the concept of the tripartite soul: a division of the human psyche into three parts: rational, spirited, and appetitive. This framework is crucial for understanding human decision-making and behavior.  \n\n**Rational Aspect:** Defined as the analytical and logic-based portion of the soul, this aspect guides actions based on logical reasoning and factual evidence. For Plato, a purely rational individual makes decisions with optimal morality. \n\n**Spirited Aspect:** The emotional, driven part of the self, connected to feelings and responses to injustice or ambitions. A decision fueled by passion like choosing not to eat bacon after reading about the plight of Wilbur in Charlotte's Web is guided by this aspect.  \n\n **Appetitive Aspect:**  Focuses on physical necessities like survival, nourishment, and seeking pleasure through sexual urges and survival behaviors.  \n The appetitive aspect governs actions related to immediate needs and desires like engaging in risky consumption behaviors. \n\n**Plato's View:** Plato believed that a society composed of primarily rational individuals governed by reason would be the most virtuous and human. He viewed those who allow emotions or desires to control them as \u201cimperfect humans.\u201d\nDespite its prevalence, the notion of three-part soul is no longer widely accepted today. We recognize that we are all motivated by physical urges, and emotional impulses but prioritize reasoned decisions in our daily lives. \n\n**Case Study: Bertrand Russell's Barber Paradox:** This demonstrates how logically sound arguments fail when they present self-contradictory propositions. A barber who is obligated to shave men who do not shave themselves can not shave himself as such violates his moral obligations, creating a fallacious argument structure.\n **Philosophical Approach to Evaluation:** Philosophical reasoning centers around the pursuit of clarity and logic through thought experiments and challenges that test our capabilities in this process. Philosophers utilize deductive reasoning \u2013  where accurate premises lead logically to conclusions \u2013 to evaluate logical consistency in arguments. \n   **Deductive Arguments** The principle for deductive logic is: if premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.   It's important to note that validity refers to the coherence of the argument itself; a valid argument with false premises might not necessarily yield true results. This is where truth-based arguments can diverge significantly from logic-based deductions, leading to challenging debates about the ethics and motivations behind our decisions.  \n",

But then there\u2019s the spirited aspect, often described as the emotional part of the self, although that doesn\u2019t quite capture it. The spirited soul isn't just about feeling\u2014it\u2019s also about how your feelings fuel your actions.

And philosophers continue to agree with Plato that reason should be in the driver\u2019s seat.  So how do you know if you\u2019re good at it? How can you test your reasoning? Well, let\u2019s head over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy. Throughout this course, we are going to apply our philosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments. \nAs you go through these concepts, keep in mind that arguments should provide evidence, such as premises, to support their conclusions.  An argument serves as a framework or system that supports an opinion or claim in favor of one point, or view over the other (conclusion). A key part of a good argument is deduction. Deductive reasoning, as it goes, begins with established premises and uses logic to arrive at a conclusion. The conclusion will be true if and only if the premise are true; a sound argument relies on consistent use of the rules of logic applied to the facts of this reality, even if they may seem to break a typical form of logic that we have known for years in math or science, or other fields of study, such as history. For instance, a premise \u201cAll humans are mortal,\u201d and another \"Socrates is human\", could be used to conclude \u201cSocrates was Plato\u2019s teacher\u201d. It is important to remember, however, that the validity of an argument must be clear first. A valid argument means its conclusion cannot logically be false under any circumstances if the premises are true.\n \n Now, there's also some more points about this whole deduction aspect on a broader level: If the premise 'All humans being mortal' is true and the premise 'Socrates IS human' is also true, then Socrates must be mortal, right?\n\n \n   Ultimately, while validity shows that truth is implied in the premises but not necessarily supported by the premises or an argument, the truth of a conclusion may not have to be given more weight than other parts of the conclusions as far as the rules of logic are concerned for a good and sound argument.\n\n",

    "text": " dang good, the appetitive aspect of your soul\nis in control. Now, Plato believed that the best human beings\n-- and I should point out here that Plato most definitely did believe that some people\nwere better than others -- are always ruled by the rational part of their soul, because it works\nto keep the spirited and the appetitive parts in check. People who allow themselves to be ruled by\ntheir spirited or appetitive selves are base, he believed, and not fully, properly human. Now, most of us don\u2019t buy into the concept\nof the tripartite soul anymore -- or the idea that some humans are less human than others. But we do understand that we\u2019re all motivated by\nphysical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments. And philosophers continue to agree with Plato\nthat reason should be in the driver\u2019s seat. So, how do you know if you\u2019re good at it?\nHow can you test your reasoning? Well, let\u2019s head over to the Thought Bubble\nfor some Flash Philosophy. Throughout this course, we\u2019re going to apply our\nphilosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments. Because remember: Philosophers love thinking about\nquestions -- especially ones that don\u2019t have ready answers. So think of these exercises as philosophical\nwind-sprints -- quick tests of your mental abilities. And here\u2019s a doozy, from 20th century British\nthinker Bertrand Russell, one of the pioneers of what\u2019s known as analytic philosophy. Say there\u2019s a town in which all men are\nrequired by law to be clean-shaven. This town has only one barber, a man, who must follow\nstrict rules: Rule number one: He must shave all men who\ndo not shave themselves. Rule number two: He must not shave any man\nwho does shave himself. It\u2019s the nightmare of every libertarian and every\nmustachio\u2019d hipster. But here\u2019s the question: Does the barber shave himself? Cause think about it: The barber only shaves\nmen who don\u2019t shave themselves. So if he does shave himself, then he must not, because the barber\u2019s\nnot allowed to shave guys who shave themselves. But, if he doesn\u2019t shave himself, then he has\nto be shaved by the barber, because that\u2019s the law. Russell came up with this puzzle to illustrate the\nfact that a group must always be a member of itself. That means, in this case, that \u201call men\nwho shave themselves\u201d has to include every guy who shaves himself, including the barber. Otherwise, the logic that dictates the group\u2019s\nexistence just doesn\u2019t hold up. And if the barber is a logical impossibility,\nthen he can\u2019t exist, which means the reasoning behind his existence is inherently flawed. And philosophy doesn\u2019t tolerate flawed reasoning. So, how do we make sure that we\u2019re ruled\nby good, sound, not-flawed reason? By perfecting the art of the argument. An argument, in philosophy, isn\u2019t just a\nshouting match. Instead, philosophers maintain that your beliefs\nshould always be backed up by reasons, which we call premises. Premises form the structure of your argument.\nThey offer evidence for your belief, and you can have as many premises as you like, as\nlong as they support your conclusion, which is the thing that you actually believe. So, let\u2019s dissect the anatomy of an argument. There are actually several different species\nof arguments. Probably the most familiar, and the easiest to carry out, is the deductive\nargument. The main rule of a deductive arguments is: if your\npremises are true, then your conclusion must be true. And knowing that something is actually true\nis very rare, and awesome. So, here\u2019s a boiled-down version of a good\ndeductive argument: Premise 1: All humans are mortal. Premise 2: Socrates is a human. Conclusion: Socrates is mortal. This kind of reasoning, where one fact leads\nto another, is called entailment. Once we know that all humans are mortal, and that\nSocrates is a human, those facts entail that Socrates is mortal. Deduction begins with the general \u2013 in this\ncase, what we know about human mortality \u2013 and reasons down to the specific \u2013 Socrates\nin particular. What\u2019s great about deductive arguments is\nthat the truth of the premises must lead to the truth of the conclusion. When this happens, we say that the argument\nis valid \u2013 there\u2019s just no way for the conclusion to be false if the premises are\ntrue. Now check out this argument: All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human.\nTherefore, Socrates was Plato\u2019s teacher That argument is invalid, because nothing about human\nmortality can prove that Socrates was Plato\u2019s teacher. As you might have noticed, there are plenty\nof mortal humans who never taught Plato. What\u2019s interesting, though, is that this\nargument does happen to have a true conclusion, which leads us to another issue. And that\nis: Validity is not the same as truth. All \u2018valid\u2019 really means is that if the premises\nare true, then your conclusion can\u2019t be false. But that doesn\u2019t mean that your\npremises prove your conclusion to be correct. Like, in the case of whether Socrates was\nPlato\u2019s teacher, the premises are true, and the conclusion is true, but the argument\nis still not valid -- because the premises don\u2019t in any way prove the conclusion. It\njust happens to be true. So, if your premises don\u2019t guarantee the truth of your\nconclusion, then you can end up with some really crappy arguments. Like this one:\n- All cats are mammals - I\u2019m a mammal\n- Therefore, I\u2019m a cat As much as part of me would like to be my\ncat, this is invalid because the conclusion doesn\u2019t entail from the premises\u2026at all. I mean, all cats are mammals, but all mammals\naren\u2019t cats. Which means there are such things as non-cat mammals, which I am just\none example of. And it probably goes without saying, but you can\nhave a perfectly valid argument and still have a false conclusion, if any of your premises are false.\nFor example:  - All humans have tails - My brother John is a human\n- Therefore, John Green has a tail! The argument is totally valid! \u2013 Because the premises\nentail the conclusion! The reasoning totally stands up! It\u2019s just that one of the premises is flawed. Since I\u2019m reasonably certain that John doesn\u2019t\nhave a tail -- I\u2019ve seen him in a bathing",
    "smry_text": "A well-reasoned approach dictates governing control, especially regarding human behavior. Plato, known for his three-part soul theory, proposed rational reasoning as central to humanity's essence and a source of good judgment, while acknowledging some inherent limitations. \n\nThe debate on the existence of  'better humans' persists but understanding basic needs like physical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments proves relevant in philosophy today. For this reason, applying philosophical principles to real-life situations is crucial.  Philosophical puzzles encourage exploration of critical thinking and reasoning abilities as a practical exercise. \n\nBertrand Russell introduced a paradox questioning self-shaving. This scenario underscores how logic requires the premise and conclusion to be true for the argument\u2019s validity to hold. A deductive, logical process can lead to conclusions supported by premises; therefore, truth is reflected in conclusions from this perspective.  \nThis applies even though sometimes \"true\" doesn't guarantee accuracy; as seen with a scenario of historical claims not necessarily proving a fact. The debate on valid versus true arguments remains vital to the success of philosophical study as well as everyday life.\n\nWhile validity signifies that premises must lead to conclusions, it does not inherently prove factual validity, nor does an incomplete argument demonstrate truth. There are other types of reasoning, including deductive and inductive methods; for example, in a simple \u201cAll cats are mammals\u201d statement leading to a conclusion like \"I am a mammal,\" the deductive argument is valid since the premises provide a basis; but these premises don\u2019t necessarily provide true information about humans, making the final conclusion invalid.  \nFinally, a flaw of any premise will often lead to an unfulfilled, unsupported argument that doesn't support its intended conclusion, even if all the premises follow logically in a system designed for deduction or inductive reasoning.\n\nFor instance, stating \u201cAll cats are mammals\" followed by \u201cTherefore, I am a cat,\u201d is simply an invalid, flawed logical argument because it asserts something to be true based solely on the premise's nature; they\u2019re independent realities that don't imply their connection or consequence. \nWhile a deduction like this one may hold some truth in philosophy, it shouldn't necessarily equate to actual reality.\n",

But it\u2019s limited, because it only works if you\u2019re starting\nwith known, true premises, which are hard to come by. And for what it\u2019s worth, deductive truths\nare usually pretty obvious.

    "smry_text": "The video discusses Russell's barbershop paradox where it analyzes a scenario involving a barber that conforms to strict rules: all men must be clean-shaven and the barber follows those rules except in a situation when he can shave himself or when a man shaves himself, which creates a logical problem about whether the barber is a member of this group. \n\nRussell illustrated this dilemma by using these rules as an example for deductive reasoning: \"All humans are mortal.\"\n\"Socrates is a human.\u201d  \n\nThen it shows how deduction works by drawing conclusions that follow logically from those premises, in cases such as deductively proving the truth of Socrates\u2019 mortal status. \nBut there's a difference between validity of an argument and its truth. Validity refers to whether or not the premises guarantee a true conclusion; here the statement \"All cats are mammals - I\u2019m a mammal \u2013 Therefore, I'm a cat\" is invalid.\n\n\nThis video also discussed about sound, good reason, and how they can be found in various forms of arguments:\n\n* **Deductive reasoning** This type of argument uses general statements to support specific conclusions, as seen in the barbershop paradox. \n* Other Forms of Reasoning: Although valuable, deduction has limitations due to a need for certain premises being true, which are often difficult to come by.\n\n\nThe episode concludes that although these types of logic and argumentation are important tools for thinking, they' re just a part of something much larger \u2013 the ability of someone to reason through arguments in a thorough manner. \n",
    "clean_text": "In 20th century Britain, philosophical pioneer Bertrand Russell introduced a thought experiment showcasing analytic philosophy's essence. Consider a town with a law requiring all men to be clean-shaven. Here's the scenario: A lone barber operates under two strict rules: Rule one states that he must shave every man not shaving himself, and rule two prohibits him from shaving anyone who does choose to shave.  This peculiar predicament is akin to a nightmare for libertarians and moustachioed hipsters. However, here lies a question: Does the barber shave himself? The logic of this scenario rests on its foundation as Russell aimed to illustrate that groups have strict membership criteria.\n\nHere's how it works: \"all men who shave themselves\" must encompass every member within that group, including the barber. If the rule contradicts him shaving himself, he doesn't; if he chooses to not do so then the barber is compelled by law. In either case, logic necessitates the groups are all members of themselves. If the barber exists but violates his own rules and does shave themself,  logic fails, rendering the group\u2019s existence flawed. \n\nRussell used this puzzle to demonstrate that a group should never contain someone who can change its rule set, it must maintain its strict membership criteria for it to exist logically. Philosophies don't tolerate flawed logic; we instead should strive for well-grounded reasoning and sound arguments. So, how do perfect arguments in philosophy? It starts with examining the structure,  there are several kinds of arguments including deductive. The most straightforward is the deductive argument, where if your premises are true, then your conclusion must be true by a process where general knowledge leads to specialized cases.\n \nA deductive argument follows premise one (All people die) and Premise two (Socrates was a person) and thusly, Conclusion Socrates was Mortal as it follows a strict line of reasoning between all humans will die so therefore Socrates is mortally as well\n\nHowever the logic of deduction is valid as the premise of its being always true. It doesn\u2019t mean your argument proves your conclusion right or valid because there may be fallacies in the structure of the conclusion, as demonstrated with the incorrect example:\n \n \"All cats are mammals- I am a mammal. Therefore, I am a cat.\" The logic is clear as all cats are mammals but not all mammals are cats.  \n\n\n A sound argument is one where its premises are entirely true or accurate so that their results are guaranteed to be valid and sound. This is deductivism and it guarantees to the end the correct result. Sound deduction is something most find challenging in real-life but they can learn it by observing these examples of logic to improve their own skills\n\n The key takeaways from this journey were sound arguments, the structure of arguments, and the power of deduction. We will further explore more types of arguments as we go through each chapter next week's episodes. \nHowever, today we talked about rationality in terms of reasoning and structure and it\u2019s an important part of philosophy.

It\u2019s an argument whose premises are all\ntrue, and that\u2019s valid, which means its conclusion is guaranteed to be true. So, sound arguments should always be your\ngoal. The reason that deduction is prized by philosophers\n-- and lots of other important kinds of thinkers -- is that it\u2019s the only kind of argument\nthat can give you a real certainty. But it\u2019s limited, because it only works if you\u2019re starting\nwith known, true premises, which are hard to come by. And for what it\u2019s worth, deductive truths\nare usually pretty obvious. They don\u2019t tend to lead us to startlingly new information, like the fact\nthat I\u2019m not a cat, or that John doesn\u2019t have a tail. So instead of starting with premises that\nare already certain, like deduction does, you\u2019re gonna have to know how to determine\nthe truth of, and your confidence in, your premises. Which means you\u2019re going to have to acquaint\nyourself with the other species of arguments, which we\u2019re gonna do next time. But today, we talked about the value of reason,\nthe structure of arguments, and we took a close look at one kind of argument: deductive\nreasoning.

    "smry_text": "<h2>Argument Structure & Deductive Reasoning</h2>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n\n* **Philosophical Argument:** The process of constructing and defending claims based on reasoning. \n* **Premise(s):**  Statements providing evidence or reasons supporting the conclusion. Premise's must be true to yield a valid argument. \n* **Conclusion:** The claim being asserted, based on the truth of the premises.\n* **Deductive Argument:** A type of logical reasoning where if the premises are true, the conclusion is guaranteed to be true.\n  \n### Deductive Reasoning\n\n* **Entailment in deduction:**  The relationship between premises and their conclusion, where following each premise leads to a certainty about the ultimate conclusion.\n    * Example: All human are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Valid deduction - Premises = Truth)\n    \n* **Validity versus Truth:** Validity is the structure of an argument; if the premises are actually true and follow logically, then the conclusion must be valid. \n    * A Valid but False Conclusion: For example, \"All cats are mammals\" + \"I'm a mammal\" \u2192 \"Therefore, I\u2019m a cat.\" - If premise (all cats are mammals) is false, the conclusion becomes invalid even though it logically follows from the premises.\n\n  * **Truth Defenses:** It is vital to have true premises before attempting deductive reasoning--and if your premises lack truth, you will not prove valid argument conclusions.\n\n\n### Limitations & Example of Invalid Arguments \n* **Non-deductive arguments:**  Often more prevalent than deductive and can be based on observations, hypotheses, or personal experience..  \n* **False Premises:** \"All cats have tails.\" + The claim that John has a tail = a false conclusion.\n\n\n<h3>Importance of Valid Arguments**\n\nValid but faulty conclusions: \"I'm a cat,\" + Premise \"All cats are mammals\" \n     - It's a valid deduction and it sounds compelling,  though the premises aren\u2019t inherently true - It's a case of seemingly solid reasoning; but there is no guarantee to its truth (validity alone does not mean accuracy).\n\n***Note:** A strong argument hinges on validity and sound logic. The structure of an argument matters: if it follows logical chains without false premises, it can be reliable. For example, \"All cats are mammals\" + \"I'm a mammal\", therefore\u2026 \n       - This is a valid deduction but the conclusion may need truth to back it up\u2014like, it may not hold when compared to cats with short legs and no whiskers. (If you have short legs, do you qualify as cat?)\n\n\n###  Moving Forward\n\nTo delve deeper into these philosophical arguments, we will explore other argument types next time!  \n \n **Note:** This transcript is designed for clear comprehension, however philosophical and academic language has been used to avoid ambiguity.",
    "clean_text": "\"And if the barber is a logical impossibility, then he can\u2019t exist, which means the reasoning behind his existence is inherently flawed. And philosophy doesn\u2019t tolerate flawed reasoning. So, how do we ensure that we're ruled by good, sound, not-flawed reason? By perfecting the art of the argument. An argument in philosophy isn't just a shouting match. Instead, philosophers maintain that your beliefs should always be backed up by reasons, which we call premises. Premises form the structure of your argument; they offer evidence for your belief, and you can have as many premises as you like, as long as they support your conclusion, which is the thing that you actually believe. So, let's dissect the anatomy of an argument. There are actually several different species of arguments. Probably the most familiar, and the easiest to carry out, is the deductive argument. The main rule of a deductive argument is: if your premises are true, then your conclusion must be true. And knowing that something is actually true is very rare and awesome. So, here\u2019s a boiled-down version of a good deductive argument: Premise 1: All humans are mortal. Premise 2: Socrates is a human. Conclusion: Socrates is mortal. This kind of reasoning, where one fact leads to another, is called entailment. Once we know that all humans are mortal, and that Socrates is a human , those facts entail that Socrates is mortal. Deduction begins with the general \u2013 in this case, what we know about human mortality \u2013 and reasons down to the specific \u2013 Socrates in particular. What\u2019s great about deductive arguments is that the truth of the premises must lead to the truth of the conclusion. When this happens, we say the argument is valid\u2014there\u2019s just no way for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. Now check out this argument: All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates was Plato's teacher. That argument is invalid because nothing about human mortality can prove that Socrates was Plato's teacher. As you might have noticed, there are plenty of mortal humans who never taught Plato. What\u2019s interesting though, is that this argument does happen to have a true conclusion, which leads us to another issue: Validity isn\u2019t the same as truth. All \u2018valid\u2019 really means is if the premises are true, then your conclusion can't be false. But that doesn't mean that your premises prove your conclusion to be correct. Like, in the case of whether Socrates was Plato\u2019s teacher, the premises are true, and the conclusion is true, but the argument is still not valid\u2014because the premises don\u2019t in any way prove the conclusion. It just happens to be true. So, if your premises don\u2019t guarantee the truth of your conclusion, then you can end up with some really crappy arguments. Like this one: - All cats are mammals - I'm a mammal. This leads to the conclusion: If all mammals have fur, then I must have fur. Therefore I am a cat. Conclusion: No, not a cat.  So why do we continue trying to create the \u201cdeductive\u201d conclusion? Because there are very few other types of arguments in use that work this way, or that seem to be able to deliver the same type of certainty. This is not because those guarantees are always true, but instead they are something that can become useful when used in a way that is careful and deliberate; like deduction. So it will help to look at this through some questions. For example: \nCan's deducing make any other kind of truth? \n\nIt only gives us certainty based on premises that are true, so how do we come up with those beforehand. What about using our skills to build better arguments and try to use a more complex method when building an argument; or even just the type of skill used in scientific argumentation?\n\nThe main point for all these kinds of thought is to think very intentionally and deeply, and to understand the nature of truth better. \n\n\n",
