By unleashing the power of empiricism. [Theme Music] Last time, we learned about 17th century philosopher\nRene Descartes, and how he upended the apple-basket that was his entire personal belief system,\nand descended into a radical skepticism, only to emerge with his conviction that: Cogito\nergo sum \u2013 I think, therefore I am. This one idea -- the fact that he was thinking\n-- or really, the fact that he was doubting -- allowed him to build back up, one by one,\nmore beliefs that he thought he could rely on. But in the end, most of the beliefs that Descartes\nended up putting back into his intellectual apple-basket had to do with the immaterial\nworld. Like, he decided that he could believe that\nhe existed, as a thinking thing. And he believed that God existed. Ultimately, he lit upon the idea that some\nof our thoughts are clear and distinct in a way that somehow guarantees their truth. But, a lot of philosophers disagreed. They\nargued that thinking on its own wasn\u2019t enough. Like, just because you\u2019re thinking, doesn\u2019t\nmean that your thoughts correspond to material reality in any reliable way. Basically, Descartes\u2019 philosophical opponents\nthought that the Cogito was a dead end. So here, we start to see a split between two\ndifferent understandings of how we can most reliably get to the nature of reality, and\ntherefore truth. Both were responses to the constant questioning that is skepticism. On\nthe one hand, there was rationalism. And on the other: empiricism Descartes, like Plato long before him, was a lover of reason. He met skepticism with rationalism. He believed that the most real things in life were ideas -- propositions that can be known through pure reason. Deductive truths, which we talked about before,\nfall into this category. And mathematical truths do, too. But by contrast, empiricism is based on the\nprinciple that the most reliable source of knowledge isn\u2019t our ideas, or our reasoning,\nbut our senses. Sure, we can know things through deduction\nand basic logic. But what actually leads us to truth, or at\nleast gives us our best shot at getting there, are things like induction, and the scientific method -- ways of thinking that tell us about the material world. Probably the most famous split among philosophers\nbetween these two camps was the life-long debate between Plato and Aristotle. Plato was convinced that Truth resided in\nthe immaterial world of Ideas, while Aristotle\u2019s attention was focused firmly on the ground. But what about in Descartes\u2019 day? If he\nwas the original prototype of the navel-gazing philosopher -- a living example of rationalist\nthinking \u2014 then his foil was was the 17th century English thinker John Locke. This is\nwhere he was born. Locke believed that we\u2019re all born as a\ntabula rasa, or a blank slate. He argued that all knowledge is\nobtained through experience. He rejected the concept of innate ideas -- the\nview that we\u2019re born pre-loaded with certain information, like what\u2019s good versus what\u2019s\nbad, or what is the nature of God. Locke thought that we are born knowing nothing. And instead, all of our knowledge comes\nto us through sense data. But one place where Locke agreed with Descartes\nwas in the idea that, just because your senses tell you something, that doesn\u2019t mean you\ncan trust it. After all, sometimes your senses give you\nfalse information, like when you think you see or hear something that\u2019s just not there. Descartes\u2019 response to this, of course,\nwas to just throw out all sense experience as an unreliable source of knowledge. But Locke didn\u2019t go that far. Instead, in\norder to figure out whether the senses accurately reflect the outside world, he introduced a\ndistinction between what he called the primary and secondary qualities of all things. Primary qualities are qualities that physical\nobjects themselves have. They\u2019re not in our minds, Locke argued -- they\u2019re actually\nin the stuff. These primary qualities include things like solidity -- the density, weight,\nand mass of an object. And also extension -- the height, depth, and width that a certain\nthing has. He also included figure, or the shape of an object, as well as mobility, which\nis this \u2013 whether it\u2019s stationary or in motion. So primary qualities, Locke said, belong to\nthe thing itself. Take this apple. It weighs maybe 150 grams,\nis the size of my palm, roundish, but firm, with the slightest bit of give, and right\nnow it\u2019s moving through the air. Those are its primary qualities. But it has secondary qualities, too. And by Locke\u2019s standards, they are not real.\nAt least not in any objective, agreed-upon way. They\u2019re just in our minds. But they\nget there through the primary qualities. I\u2019m talking about things like its color, taste,\ntexture, smell, and sound. The secondary qualities of this apple are\nits redness, and how it tastes and smells and feels on my tongue and hand. Even how\nit sounds when I bite into it. Locke believed that the distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities explained the disagreements that we all have about our\nperceptions of the outside world. Like, we could measure this apple in a bunch\nof ways and all agree on its primary qualities, but its secondary qualities would no doubt\nlead to some disputes. Like, is it really red?

    "smry_text": "<h2>Understanding Reality: A Crash Course in Logic and Empiricism</h2>\n\nThis segment delves into the history of philosophical inquiry surrounding truth and reality. The speaker begins by highlighting Ren\u00e9 Descartes's pioneering approach to finding certainty, based on the \"Cogito ergo sum\" principle (I think therefore I am).  \n\nDescartes built his understanding of reality upon reasoning and logic, placing key emphasis on the immaterial world\u2014a perspective later challenged by other philosophers. These viewpoints are contrasted with empiricism, where knowledge derived from sensory experiences is deemed more reliable for understanding material reality. \n\nThe speaker discusses a foundational rivalry: rationalists versus empiricists - highlighting the contributions of influential figures like Plato and Aristotle, as well as John Locke. Locke's \"tabula rasa\" theory suggests humans are born without innate knowledge or preconceptions, acquiring all information from their sensory experiences. He proposes dividing objects based on \"primary qualities\" (inherent characteristics of the object itself)  and those we attribute to our senses (\"secondary qualities\") - including color, taste, texture, smell and sound. These characteristics are believed to be subjective interpretations based on the primary qualities. \n\nThis segment concludes by emphasizing that Locke saw inconsistencies between our perceptions (our \"secondary qualities\") as a factor in disagreement regarding reality, suggesting a constant process of reevaluation and refinement is necessary for constructing an accurate model.  \n",

The goal was to build a belief based on certainty (Cogito, ergo sum), which essentially means \"I think, therefore I am.\"\n\n* **Empiricism vs. Rationalism; the Main Philosophic Divides:** Both perspectives are detailed: \n   * **Rationalism**: believes that clear and distinct ideas can be obtained through reason alone. A heavy focus on logical reasoning and abstract concepts. Descartes is a notable example.\n    \n   * **Empiricalism**: The belief that knowledge originates from sensory experiences; through our senses, we learn to know the world around us.

It becomes symbolic of challenging our perception about reality and how we understand it through senses as opposed to logic and theory.\n\n**To summarize:**\n\n\nThis transcript gives insight into foundational topics like empiricism, rationalism, Descartes' method, and the nature of our world's understanding.

    "smry_text": "<h2> Descartes' Materialism </h2>\nDescartes' philosophical journey led him to prioritize his immaterial world; believing he could confidently assert existence as a thinking entity and God's existence alongside clear thoughts being reliable indicators of truth.  Many philosophers disagreed, believing that solely relying on thought was not accurate for accessing the nature of reality or attaining truth. This disagreement led to two major schools of philosophical thought: rationalism and empiricism. \n\n<h2>Rationalism vs Empiricism</h2>\n* **Rationalists**, championed by Descartes and Plato before him, viewed ideas and propositions as the most real entities, emphasizing deduction of absolute truths such as mathematical principles. However, this perspective was not universally accepted.  \n* **Empiricism**, rooted in John Locke's reasoning, relied on sensory experiences for gaining knowledge. It sought truth from observation through induction and the scientific method, which helps explore physical reality more efficiently than solely relying on reason. \n\n**Locke's Theory: Primary Qualities Over Secondary**\nJohn Locke, a key figure of empiricism, argued that individuals are blank slates upon entering the world.  He believed knowledge was derived solely from experience, rejecting innate ideas like 'good' or \u2018evil,\u2019 which were inherent but not experienced. Locke divided qualities of objects into two categories: primary and secondary. \n\n* **Primary Qualities:** These tangible properties such as \"weight,\" \"size,\" \"shape,\" and \"mobility\" are intrinsic quality within the object itself; these are unaffected by human experiences and understanding.\n    * Example - an apple's mass (weight) is a primary quality, independent of its perceived size or color.\n* **Secondary Qualities:**  Intangible qualities such as color, taste, texture, smell, and sound  are attributed to secondary features that arise in our minds after experience with the object; they are subjective in nature, depending on interpretation of sensory data.\n    * Example- the apple\u2019s \u201credness\u201d becomes a secondary quality as we see it, not a fundamental physical property\n\n\n **Locke's Impact** \nThis approach to perception profoundly impacted philosophers like George Berkeley \u2013 he took Locke's empiricism to a logical extreme to such an extent that he challenged the very concept of reality's existence. His idea was a departure from both traditional ideas and traditional empirism itself. \n\n\n\n\n",

Like, you can\u2019t\ndetect an apple\u2019s shape without first -- or at least without also -- detecting its color.\nWhen you think about it, you can\u2019t detect any of the primary qualities without also\nconsidering the secondary ones. You can\u2019t see a colorless apple.\nYou can\u2019t feel a textureless apple.

    "smry_text": "This transcript discusses different philosophical schools of thought pertaining to knowledge and perception.\n\n**Deductive Truths vs Empiricism:** \n- Deductive truths (based on logic) and mathematical truths were deemed reliable sources of knowledge.  But empiricism, championed by philosophers like Locke and Berkeley, challenged this.  Empiricists asserted that the most reliable source of knowledge is derived from sensory experiences.\n\n**Locke's Epistemology: Primary and Secondary Qualities:** \n- John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher, argued that all knowledge originates from experience (tabula rasa)\n     \n **The Distinctions of Primary vs. Secondary Qualities:**  \n - Locke proposed a distinction between primary (inherent properties of an object) and secondary (perceived qualities), arguing they were not in his mind until the apple was experienced;  Locke believed that the true physical attributes remained intact independent of our perception of them.\n\n **The Impact of Primary Properties:**   Locke asserted that primary qualities are objective and measurable, unaffected by individual perceptions.  These characteristics relate to an object\u2019s physical properties, such as color, shape, texture, weight, etc. \n - He argued if an object lacks secondary qualities they cannot be perceived; \n\n **Berkeley's Critique of Locke:**   George Berkeley expanded on Locke's empiricism further by analyzing primary versus secondary qualities:\n -  He challenged the idea that we can separate perceived attributes (secondary) and actual properties of an object purely (primary). \n\n\n**The Inescapability of Secondary Qualities:**\n- The analysis of both Locke and Berkeley shows how perception interlinks with objects in a way that their separate classification based on primary and secondary causes issues. For example, the apple\u2019s color contributes to the perception process because it is tied to the shape; if one were only perceiving the shape there would not be the \u201cshape\u201d we experience with the secondary qualities at play. The apple must have both for all to understand what the object represents in our minds and eyes\n\n \n\n\nLet me know how I can help you.  \n",

It should retain all the original phrases for authenticity. Do not add any new information, do not express your opinions about the speaker and do not suggest any follow up query.\n\nDeductive truths, which we talked about before, fall into this category. And mathematical truths do, too. But by contrast, empiricism is based on the principle that the most reliable source of knowledge isn\u2019t our ideas or reasoning, but our senses. Sure, we can know things through deduction and basic logic. But what actually leads us to truth, or at least gives us our best shot at getting there are things like induction, and the scientific method \u2014 ways of thinking that tell us about the material world. Probably the most famous split among philosophers between these two camps was the life-long debate between Plato and Aristotle. Plato was convinced that Truth resided in the immaterial world of Ideas, while Aristotle\u2019s attention was focused firmly on the ground. But what about in Descartes' day? If he was the original prototype of the navel-gazing philosopher \u2014 a living example of rationalist thinking \u2014 then his foil was was the 17th century English thinker John Locke. This is where he was born. Locked believed that we\u2019re all born as a tabula rasa, or a blank slate. He argued that all knowledge is obtained through experience. He rejected the concept of innate ideas \u2014 the view that we're born pre-loaded with certain information, like what's good versus what's bad, or what is the nature of God. Locke thought that we are born knowing nothing. And instead, all of our knowledge comes to us through sense data. But one place where Locke agreed with Descartes was in the idea that just because your senses tell you something doesn\u2019t mean you can trust it. After all, sometimes your senses give you false information, like when you think you see or hear something that\u2019s just not there. Descartes' response to this was to just throw out all sense experience as an unreliable source of knowledge. But Locke didn\u2019t go that far. Instead, in order to figure out whether the senses accurately reflect the outside world, he introduced a distinction between what he called the primary and secondary qualities of all things. Primary qualities are qualities that physical objects themselves have. Secondary qualities are qualities that depend on someone's perception. For example, an apple\u2019s red color is a secondary quality, because it exists only for as long as a person looking at it has their vision to perceive it. \n\nLocke\u2019s reasoning was simple, even elegant, extracting a lot of explanatory power out of very few basic concepts. As a result, it resonated with a lot people. And one person it resonated strongly is the Irish philosopher George Berkeley. He was moved by Locke\u2019s empiricism and took it seriously \u2014 so seriously, in fact, that ended up using Locke\u2019s own logic against him. He basically took empiricism to its logical conclusion, dismantling the whole process of perception to the point that he had to wonder whether anything existed at all. Berkeley began by taking apart the distinction that Locke made between primary and secondary qualities. Like, think about this apple again. How do you know its shape? Locke said that the apple\u2019s shape, as a primary quality, is immediately perceivable. But Berkeley pointed out that you don't perceive some qualities of an object, while totally disregarding others. It's like you can't detect an apple's shape without first \u2014 or at least without also \u2014 detecting its color. When you think about it, you can\u2019t detect any of the primary qualities without also considering the secondary ones. You can\u2019t see a colorless apple. You can\u2019t feel a textureless apple. In fact, if you try to strip away the apple\u2019s secondary qualities in an effort to get at the primary ones, you end up with no apple at all. Try it: Close your eyes and imagine an Apple made of only primary qualities \u2014 so it has a certain shape and a certain size, but it doesn\u2019t have any color or texture or taste. You can\u2019t do it.  You try to imagine it with no color, but really, you're probably imagining one that\u2019s either black or white or transparent\u2014 the color of what\u2019s behind it. \n\n\nLocke asserted that secondary qualities are not objectively real. They can only be subjectively perceived. But now, Berkeley has shown that the two are inextricably linked \u2014 you can\u2019t have one without the other.  \n",

    "smry_text": "**Locke's Empiricism and Beyond**\n\nJohn Locke believed that all knowledge comes from sensory experiences (sense data). He agreed with Ren\u00e9 Descartes in the idea that our senses cannot always provide reliable information. \n\nLocke differentiated between primary qualities, which are inherent to objects themselves (shape, size, weight), and secondary qualities (color, taste, texture) which exist only in minds. Primary qualities could be directly perceived, while secondary qualities were more subjective and contingent upon perception.  This distinction provided a way to understand discrepancies in perceptions of the outside world, such as disagreements about an apple's shade (such as 'cardinal red' vs 'carmine red').  Locke's approach resonated with many including George Berkeley, who took his ideas further:\n\n**Berkeley and Empiricism**\n\nGeorge Berkeley, profoundly influenced by Locke\u2019s empiricism, challenged the idea that primary qualities can truly exist independently of our perception. He proposed a radical view, starting by noting we can't perceive an object's shape without also perceiving its color or texture. Additionally, he emphasized how even if we try to separate secondary qualities (color, taste) from primary qualities (shape), they remain entwined; thus, attempting this separation leaves us with nothing but mental constructs and not the true reality of objects. \n\n **Berkeley's \"Esse est Percepi: \"** \nFrom these ideas, Berkeley concluded that there is no thing outside perception itself. Instead, he claimed that \"There is nothing real except perception.\" This bold claim led him to the belief that existence itself is fundamentally dependent on perception and can be eradicated entirely when perceptions cease.\n\n **Mind over Matter?: The Impact of Berkeley\u2019s Ideas**\nBerkeley's idea challenged the core tenets of material idealism that had been shaping Western thought for centuries. He proposed a profound shift in the way we think about existence by emphasizing the interconnectedness of mind and its relationship to objects. While his ideas were counterintuitive and have yet to become widely accepted, they significantly changed how perceptions shape our reality today. \n",

    "smry_text": "John Locke's philosophy emphasized distinguishing \"primary qualities,\" inherent properties of an object (e.g., size, shape), from \"secondary qualities,\" which are subjective perceptions and sensations related to these qualities (e.g., color, taste).  Locke believed that primary qualities were objective facts readily observable and agreed upon. Secondary qualities are perceived by the mind and their existence is dependent on sensory experience. \n\nGeorge Berkeley, influenced by Locke's ideas, further advanced the concept of empiricism.  He contended that secondary qualities were not merely perceptions; they inherently define an object.  Locke asserted these perceptions contribute to primary qualities as a result of complex perceptual processes. However, according to Berkeley, these secondary qualities are in fact inseparable from primary qualities and cannot be experienced independently.\n\nThis philosophical tension culminated in Berkeley's assertion \u2013 \"esse est percepi: \"to be is to be perceived,\" stating existence solely relies on perception.  Essentially, there is no true or objective real nature beyond the perceptions of a mind.  This challenged the notion of an independent reality, including physical objects that do not exist outside of our sensory experiences.\n\nTo address this, Berkeley posited God as the ultimate perceiver capable of sustaining and perceiving \"real\" existence even in the absence of conscious perception. The philosopher believed that if one cannot perceive themselves, then they cease to exist! The persistence of reality ultimately depends on God's presence and active observation. \t\n\n\n\n",

He essentially took empiricism to its logical conclusion, dismantling the whole process of perception to the point where he had to wonder whether anything existed at all. Berkeley began by taking apart the distinction that Locke made between primary and secondary qualities.  Like, think about this apple again. How do you know its shape? Locke said that the apple\u2019s shape, as a primary quality is immediately perceivable. But Berkeley pointed out that it can't exist without its perception as well; things only exist in our minds. Berkeley believed that there was really no such thing as matter, or as if it existed for ourselves. In his view, all we really have is perception.  His famous assertion \u2013 his version of \u201ccogito ergo sum\u201d \u2013 was \"esse est percepi,\" meaning \"to be is to be perceived.\" In his opinion, there are no objects; only perceivers and even the perceivers themselves don\u2019t really have any physical form when they're perceiving them that isn\u2019t actually there.  This kind of scenario is a little bit terrifying to think about in your own mind, as it means we all might just be nothing but thought at the end. But in Berkeley\u2019s version of reality: if everything\u2019s just perception then when the perception goes away, there can't be anything left. So, for example, please don't turn away from your computer if anything! If you stop perceiving me, I would cease to exist!  But what if maybe you don\u2019t care about me? Still, you had better not go to sleep, because, as soon as you do, you won't see yourself anymore. The only guarantee that you'll continue to exist in your sleep is to have a friend watch you when you\u2019re sleeping.\n   A little bit scary: it is just the perception alone that can exist. We are sensory beings!  We really need this apple to exist! Next time we are going to take a side journey into the world of knowledge. And then, in Episode 8, we'll see if Karl Popper might be able to get the physical world back for us. Today we\u2019ve learned about empiricism from a skepticism response to explore Locke and the distinction between primary and secondary qualities by George Berkeley: ultimately showing these distinctions couldn\u2019t hold up against reality. \n\n\n\n",

Because primary qualities have nothing to do with you, or me. Instead they have everything to do with the object itself.

Locke said that the apple\u2019s shape, as a\nprimary quality, is immediately perceivable. But Berkeley pointed out that you don\u2019t\nperceive some qualities of an object, while totally disregarding others. Like, you can\u2019t\ndetect an apple\u2019s shape without first -- or at least without also -- detecting its color.\nWhen you think about it, you can\u2019t detect any of the primary qualities without also\nconsidering the secondary ones. You can\u2019t see a colorless apple.\nYou can\u2019t feel a textureless apple. In fact, if you try to strip away the apple\u2019s\nsecondary qualities in an effort to get at the primary ones, you end up with no apple\nat all. Try it: Close your eyes and imagine an apple\nmade of only primary qualities -- so, it has a certain shape and a certain size, but it\ndoesn\u2019t have any color or texture or taste. You can\u2019t do it. You try to imagine it with no color, but really,\nyou\u2019re probably imagining one that\u2019s either black or white or transparent -- the color\nof what\u2019s behind it. And if you try to imagine it as having no\ntexture, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s still a texture there \u2013 it\u2019s just smooth. Remember: Locke asserted that secondary qualities\nare not objectively real. They can only be subjectively perceived. But now, Berkeley\nhas shown that the two are inextricably linked \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other. Which means that primary qualities can\u2019t\nbe real, either. They, too, are just what your mind makes of things. So this led Berkeley to a startling conclusion:\nThere\u2019s just no such thing as matter. There can\u2019t be! Instead, there\u2019s only\nperceptions. Berkeley\u2019s famous assertion --\nhis version of cogito ergo sum -- was esse est percepi:\n\u201cto be is to be perceived.\u201d In his opinion, there are no objects, only\nperceivers \u2013 and even then, the perceivers themselves don\u2019t really have any physical\nform. They\u2019re just disembodied minds perceiving things that aren\u2019t really there. A little bit terrifying when you start thinking\nabout it. In Berkeley\u2019s scenario, we\u2019re all set\nadrift in a world of nothing but thought. What\u2019s scary about it is this, if everything\u2019s\njust perception, then when the perception goes away, there can\u2019t be anything left. So like, please, for the love of Pete, do\nnot turn away from your computer! If you stop perceiving me, I stop existing! But, what if maybe you don\u2019t care about\nme? Still, you\u2019d better not go to sleep, because as soon as you do, you\u2019ll cease\nto exist! Because, you won\u2019t be able to perceive yourself! The only guarantee that\nyou\u2019ll continue to exist in your sleep is to have a friend watch you when you\u2019re sleeping. Which probably is a non-starter, for a number of reasons. But in any case, the second your\nfriend blinks, you\u2019re gone! So in the end, Berkeley believed there was\nonly one thing that kept us -- and everything else -- from disappearing into oblivion. God.\nBerkeley believed that God was the Ultimate Perceiver. God is always watching, with unblinking perception that holds objects in existence even when we\u2019re not paying attention. The tough thing about Berkeley is, we all\npretty much think he has to be wrong. Very few of us are willing to give up our belief in the physical world \u2014 no matter who\u2019s watching. We are sensory animals!\nWe really need this apple to exist. Next time, we\u2019re going to take a side journey\ninto the world of knowledge. And then, in episode 8, we\u2019ll see if Karl Popper can\nmanage to get the physical world back for us. Today we have learned about empiricism as\na response to skepticism. We talked about John Locke and his distinction between primary\nand secondary qualities. And we\u2019ve seen why George Berkeley thinks that distinction\nultimately falls apart -- leaving us with literally nothing but our minds, ideas, and\nperceptions.

    "smry_text": "**Summary:**\n\nThis video excerpt examines prominent philosopher George Berkeley's unique perspective on the nature of reality, focusing on his critique of John Locke's theory of primary qualities.  The conversation dives into the idea that perception inherently impacts what we perceive, and thus, \"things\" can not exist in a vacuum apart from subjective awareness. \n\n**Berkeley\u2019s Critique:**\n\nJohn Locke proposed a distinction between the objectively real \u201cprimary qualities\u201d of an object \u2013 such as its shape and size - and more subjectively perceived \"secondary qualities\" \u2013 like color or texture. Berkeley challenged this distinction by asserting a much deeper interconnectedness between primary and secondary quality.  He suggested that perception is inextricably linked to both form and substance, ultimately arguing that there are not objectively real objects but merely perceptions in a world of endless mind/matter interplay. \n\n**The \"Esse Est Percepi\" Theorem:** \nBerkeley's famous assertion \"esse est percepi\" literally translates \u201cTo be is to be perceived.\u201d This profound statement postulates that reality itself consists of only the inherent act of perceiving \u2013  meaning there are no tangible, independent objects but merely minds actively perceiving these objects.\n\n**God as Reality?**\n\nThe argument extended further with Berkeley's belief that God, through his \"unblinking perception,\" holds existence together even when we are unobservant and aware. This brings up a significant question: can our own senses be trusted alone, given the potential to vanish into nothing?  Although seemingly illogical to many people, this question prompts us to explore whether our physical reality is truly real or merely a product of subjective consciousness.\n\n**Continuing the Journey:**\n\n The video wraps by discussing how the argument regarding Berkeley\u2019s perspective on reality might seem counter to our human experience being reliant on sensory data for understanding the world. To further this debate, the show explores George Berkeley\u2019s reasoning and then delves into an alternative presented by Karl Popper, in a future episode aimed at investigating whether a physical universe is possible or merely subjective, alluding to how ideas on reality are still under consideration within philosophy and can lead to interesting perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** The summary maintains the original phraseology and omits any opinions about the speaker or myself.",
