Aristotle once described humans as \u201cthe\nrational animal.\u201d Well, actually, he said that \u201cman is the\nrational animal,\u201d but we don\u2019t have to be sexist just because he was. And if you\u2019ve ever gotten into an argument\nwith someone about religion or politics or which Hemsworth is the hottest, then you\u2019ve experienced\nhow irrational people can be about their opinions. But what Aristotle meant is that rationality\nis our distinguishing characteristic \u2013 it\u2019s what sets us apart from the beasts. And no matter how much you disagree with someone\nabout God or Obama or Chris Hemsworth, you can at least grant that they are not beasts. Because, most of the time at least, people\ncan be persuaded. By arguments. You use arguments all the time -- in the comments,\nat family dinners, with your friends -- you probably just don\u2019t think of them the same\nway that philosophers do. When you try and convince your parents to\nloan you the car, or when you\u2019re talking up Crash Course to your friends, you are using\narguments. Thanks, by the way. Each time you tell someone to do or believe\nsomething -- or when you\u2019re explaining why you do or believe something -- you are giving\nan argument. The problem is, the vast majority of people\naren\u2019t really good at arguments. We tend to confuse making a good argument\nwith, like, having witty comebacks, or just making your points more loudly and angrily,\ninstead of building a case on a solid foundation of logic. Which can be harder than it sounds. But learning about arguments and strong reasoning\nwill not only make you a better philosopher, it will also set you up to be a more persuasive\nperson. Someone who people will listen to. Someone who\u2019s convincing. So, yeah, these skills are beneficial no matter\nwhat you want to do with your life. So you might as well know how to argue properly. [Theme Music] If you want to learn how to argue, then you\nshould probably start about 2400 years ago, when Plato was laying out how reason can,\nand should, function in the human mind. He believed that we all have what he called\na tripartite soul \u2013 what you might think of as your \u201cself,\u201d or your psyche, divided\ninto three parts. First, there\u2019s the rational, or logical\npart of the soul, which represents cool reason. This is the aspect of your self that seeks\nthe truth and is swayed by facts and arguments. When you decide to stop eating bacon for two\nmeals a day because, as delicious as it is, it\u2019s bad for you, then you make that decision\nwith the guidance of the rational part of your soul. But then there\u2019s the spirited aspect, often\ndescribed as the emotional part of the self, although that doesn\u2019t really quite capture\nit. The spirited soul isn\u2019t just about feeling\n-- it\u2019s also about how your feelings fuel your actions. It\u2019s the part that responds in righteous\nanger at injustice, the part that drives your ambition, and calls upon you to protect others. It gives you a sense of honor and duty, and\nis swayed by sympathy. So if you decide to stop eating bacon because\nyou just finished reading Charlotte\u2019s Web, and now you\u2019re in love with Wilbur, then\nyou\u2019re being guided by the spirited part of your soul. But we share the next part of our soul with\nother animals, be they pig, or moose, or aardvark. The appetitive part is what drives you to\neat, have sex, and protect yourself from danger. It is swayed by temptations that are carnal,\nand visceral. So at those times when you go ahead and just\nEAT ALL THE BACON because it just smells so dang good, the appetitive aspect of your soul\nis in control. Now, Plato believed that the best human beings\n-- and I should point out here that Plato most definitely did believe that some people\nwere better than others -- are always ruled by the rational part of their soul, because it works\nto keep the spirited and the appetitive parts in check. People who allow themselves to be ruled by\ntheir spirited or appetitive selves are base, he believed, and not fully, properly human. Now, most of us don\u2019t buy into the concept\nof the tripartite soul anymore -- or the idea that some humans are less human than others. But we do understand that we\u2019re all motivated by\nphysical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments. And philosophers continue to agree with Plato\nthat reason should be in the driver\u2019s seat. So, how do you know if you\u2019re good at it?\nHow can you test your reasoning? Well, let\u2019s head over to the Thought Bubble\nfor some Flash Philosophy. Throughout this course, we\u2019re going to apply our\nphilosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments. Because remember: Philosophers love thinking about\nquestions -- especially ones that don\u2019t have ready answers. So think of these exercises as philosophical\nwind-sprints -- quick tests of your mental abilities. And here\u2019s a doozy, from 20th century British\nthinker Bertrand Russell, one of the pioneers of what\u2019s known as analytic philosophy. Say there\u2019s a town in which all men are\nrequired by law to be clean-shaven. This town has only one barber, a man, who must follow\nstrict rules: Rule number one: He must shave all men who\ndo not shave themselves. Rule number two: He must not shave any man\nwho does shave himself. It\u2019s the nightmare of every libertarian and every\nmustachio\u2019d hipster. But here\u2019s the question: Does the barber shave himself? Cause think about it: The barber only shaves\nmen who don\u2019t shave themselves. So if he does shave himself, then he must not, because the barber\u2019s\nnot allowed to shave guys who shave themselves. But, if he doesn\u2019t shave himself, then he has\nto be shaved by the barber, because that\u2019s the law. Russell came up with this puzzle to illustrate the\nfact that a group must always be a member of itself. That means, in this case, that \u201call men\nwho shave themselves\u201d has to include every guy who shaves himself, including the barber. Otherwise, the logic that dictates the group\u2019s\nexistence just doesn\u2019t hold up.",
    "smry_text": "### Aristotle's Concept of Human Rationality\n\nThis video explores the concept of human rationality as described by philosopher Aristotle. He argued that humans are the rational animal, distinguishing them from animals in their ability to reason and engage in logical discussions. \n\nHumans possess a \"rational\" part within ourselves, driven by logic, facts, and arguments. This aspect guides decisions like choosing healthy food.  \n\nThe video explains further that our soul consists of three parts:\n  * **Rational:** This part strives for truth through logic and evidence-based reasoning, guiding decision-making based on facts.\n  * **Spiritually Motivated:** This encompasses passion, empathy, emotions driving actions like standing up for justice or exhibiting ambition. \n  * **Appetite/Survival:** This governs desires like eating, having sexual relationships and protecting ourselves from harm influenced by our physical needs and temptations.\n\n While modern thinking diverges from the concept of a strict three-part soul (the term was a philosophical idea), we still understand that humans are driven by physical desires, emotional impulses and rational arguments as these elements play a role in how we act. \n\n\n### The Importance of Reasoning Skills\n\nThe video emphasizes why practicing argumentation is essential beyond just debating with friends.  Reasoning skills are valuable tools for:\n   *  Effective communication and persuasion\n   *  Deepened knowledge and understanding\n\nThrough various philosophical exercises, including thought experiments like Bertrand Russell\u2019s Barber Paradox, participants will test their reasoning abilities \u2013 sharpening them in the process. \n\nIn conclusion, the video stresses that reasoning plays a central role in human life and its effectiveness in achieving success can be seen through studying Plato's theories of the soul where the rational part is deemed to be superior in guiding behaviour.   \n   \n\n\n\n",

Here\u2019s why you need to think about this: If he shaves himself, then he should be able to, based on rule number one, shave only those who do not shave themselves - according to rule number two, he can't and must not in an act of logic. But if the barber does not shave himself, then he would meet the requirement by rule number one of shaving only those not shaving themselves, as stated by rule number two.  But that logic also leads us to a position where all men must also be clean shaved as per these rules; The argument here is this: That makes it much more difficult to understand what constitutes the barber's responsiblity when considering all the people he needs to shave. As such, the only reason for the barber being able to cut his hair at all, is if those around him don\u2019t have time or ability to shave themselves, which would then make this a purely logistical task rather than something requiring physical action and therefore rule-breaking.\n\n\n\n",

Premises form the structure of your argument.\nThey offer evidence for your belief, and you can have as many premises as you like, as\nlong as they support your conclusion, which is the thing that you actually believe.

    "smry_text": "Philosophy explores the principles of human nature, starting with the tripartite soul, which comprises three parts:  the rational (logical), spirited (emotional), and appetitive (driven by needs).  \n\nPlato believed in the dominance of rationality over other aspects for optimal human functioning. He saw emotions (spirited) as powerful, but they shouldn't control us. Likewise, our physical desires require attention.\n\nThis theory finds its reflection in real-life decision-making when applying logic to everyday scenarios. Understanding these ideas can help develop a more sound understanding of ourselves and others. \n\nTo test one\u2019s strength with arguments, engaging in philosophical exercises provides answers to questions that might have no clear-cut solutions. These inquiries challenge our assumptions and encourage critical thinking. Think of Bertrand Russell's barber paradox as an example \u2014 this puzzling scenario tests the concept that all men must belong to themselves as part of the whole group. \n\nA good argument must be backed by valid premise evidence so if there is a flaw in reasoning, then the argument itself can be flawed and needs revision/rethinking for truth. \n",

    "smry_text": "### The Tripartite Soul and Ethical Reasoning:\n\nThis transcript explores the concept of the tripartite soul: a division of the human psyche into three parts: rational, spirited, and appetitive. This framework is crucial for understanding human decision-making and behavior.  \n\n**Rational Aspect:** Defined as the analytical and logic-based portion of the soul, this aspect guides actions based on logical reasoning and factual evidence. For Plato, a purely rational individual makes decisions with optimal morality. \n\n**Spirited Aspect:** The emotional, driven part of the self, connected to feelings and responses to injustice or ambitions. A decision fueled by passion like choosing not to eat bacon after reading about the plight of Wilbur in Charlotte's Web is guided by this aspect.  \n\n **Appetitive Aspect:**  Focuses on physical necessities like survival, nourishment, and seeking pleasure through sexual urges and survival behaviors.  \n The appetitive aspect governs actions related to immediate needs and desires like engaging in risky consumption behaviors. \n\n**Plato's View:** Plato believed that a society composed of primarily rational individuals governed by reason would be the most virtuous and human. He viewed those who allow emotions or desires to control them as \u201cimperfect humans.\u201d\nDespite its prevalence, the notion of three-part soul is no longer widely accepted today. We recognize that we are all motivated by physical urges, and emotional impulses but prioritize reasoned decisions in our daily lives. \n\n**Case Study: Bertrand Russell's Barber Paradox:** This demonstrates how logically sound arguments fail when they present self-contradictory propositions. A barber who is obligated to shave men who do not shave themselves can not shave himself as such violates his moral obligations, creating a fallacious argument structure.\n **Philosophical Approach to Evaluation:** Philosophical reasoning centers around the pursuit of clarity and logic through thought experiments and challenges that test our capabilities in this process. Philosophers utilize deductive reasoning \u2013  where accurate premises lead logically to conclusions \u2013 to evaluate logical consistency in arguments. \n   **Deductive Arguments** The principle for deductive logic is: if premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.   It's important to note that validity refers to the coherence of the argument itself; a valid argument with false premises might not necessarily yield true results. This is where truth-based arguments can diverge significantly from logic-based deductions, leading to challenging debates about the ethics and motivations behind our decisions.  \n",
    "clean_text": "The aspect of your self that seeks the truth and is swayed by facts and arguments. When you decide to stop eating bacon for two meals a day because, as delicious as it is, it\u2019s bad for you, then you make that decision with the guidance of the rational part of your soul. But then there\u2019s the spirited aspect, often described as the emotional part of the self, although that doesn\u2019t quite capture it. The spirited soul isn't just about feeling\u2014it\u2019s also about how your feelings fuel your actions. It\u2019s the part that responds in righteous anger at injustice and calls upon you to protect others.  It gives you a sense of honor and duty and is swayed by sympathy. So, if you decide to stop eating bacon because you just finished reading Charlotte's Web and now you\u2019re in love with Wilbur, then you are being guided by the spirited part of your soul. But we share the next part of our souls with other animals\u2014be they pig, moose, or aardvark. The appetitive part is what drives you to eat, have sex, and protect yourself from danger. It is swayed by temptations that are carnal and visceral. So at those times when you go ahead and just EAT ALL THE BACON because it just smells so dang good, the appetitive aspect of your soul is in control. \n Now, Plato believed that the best human beings\u2014and I should point out  here that Plato most definitely did believe that some people were better than others\u2014are always ruled by the rational part of their soul, because it works to keep the spirited and the appetitive parts in check. People who allow themselves to be ruled by their spirited or appetitive selves are base, he believed, and not fully, properly human.  Most of us don\u2019t buy into the concept of the tripartite soul anymore\u2014or the idea that some humans are less human than others. But we do understand that we're all motivated by physical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments. And philosophers continue to agree with Plato that reason should be in the driver\u2019s seat.  So how do you know if you\u2019re good at it? How can you test your reasoning? Well, let\u2019s head over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy. Throughout this course, we are going to apply our philosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments. \nAs you go through these concepts, keep in mind that arguments should provide evidence, such as premises, to support their conclusions.  An argument serves as a framework or system that supports an opinion or claim in favor of one point, or view over the other (conclusion). A key part of a good argument is deduction. Deductive reasoning, as it goes, begins with established premises and uses logic to arrive at a conclusion. The conclusion will be true if and only if the premise are true; a sound argument relies on consistent use of the rules of logic applied to the facts of this reality, even if they may seem to break a typical form of logic that we have known for years in math or science, or other fields of study, such as history. For instance, a premise \u201cAll humans are mortal,\u201d and another \"Socrates is human\", could be used to conclude \u201cSocrates was Plato\u2019s teacher\u201d. It is important to remember, however, that the validity of an argument must be clear first. A valid argument means its conclusion cannot logically be false under any circumstances if the premises are true.\n \n Now, there's also some more points about this whole deduction aspect on a broader level: If the premise 'All humans being mortal' is true and the premise 'Socrates IS human' is also true, then Socrates must be mortal, right?\n\n \n   Ultimately, while validity shows that truth is implied in the premises but not necessarily supported by the premises or an argument, the truth of a conclusion may not have to be given more weight than other parts of the conclusions as far as the rules of logic are concerned for a good and sound argument.\n\n",

Throughout this course, we\u2019re going to apply our\nphilosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments. Because remember: Philosophers love thinking about\nquestions -- especially ones that don\u2019t have ready answers. So think of these exercises as philosophical\nwind-sprints -- quick tests of your mental abilities. And here\u2019s a doozy, from 20th century British\nthinker Bertrand Russell, one of the pioneers of what\u2019s known as analytic philosophy. Say there\u2019s a town in which all men are\nrequired by law to be clean-shaven. This town has only one barber, a man, who must follow\nstrict rules: Rule number one: He must shave all men who\ndo not shave themselves. Rule number two: He must not shave any man\nwho does shave himself. It\u2019s the nightmare of every libertarian and every\nmustachio\u2019d hipster. But here\u2019s the question: Does the barber shave himself? Cause think about it: The barber only shaves\nmen who don\u2019t shave themselves. So if he does shave himself, then he must not, because the barber\u2019s\nnot allowed to shave guys who shave themselves. But, if he doesn\u2019t shave himself, then he has\nto be shaved by the barber, because that\u2019s the law. Russell came up with this puzzle to illustrate the\nfact that a group must always be a member of itself. That means, in this case, that \u201call men\nwho shave themselves\u201d has to include every guy who shaves himself, including the barber. Otherwise, the logic that dictates the group\u2019s\nexistence just doesn\u2019t hold up. And if the barber is a logical impossibility,\nthen he can\u2019t exist, which means the reasoning behind his existence is inherently flawed. And philosophy doesn\u2019t tolerate flawed reasoning. So, how do we make sure that we\u2019re ruled\nby good, sound, not-flawed reason? By perfecting the art of the argument. An argument, in philosophy, isn\u2019t just a\nshouting match. Instead, philosophers maintain that your beliefs\nshould always be backed up by reasons, which we call premises. Premises form the structure of your argument.\nThey offer evidence for your belief, and you can have as many premises as you like, as\nlong as they support your conclusion, which is the thing that you actually believe. So, let\u2019s dissect the anatomy of an argument. There are actually several different species\nof arguments. Probably the most familiar, and the easiest to carry out, is the deductive\nargument. The main rule of a deductive arguments is: if your\npremises are true, then your conclusion must be true. And knowing that something is actually true\nis very rare, and awesome. So, here\u2019s a boiled-down version of a good\ndeductive argument: Premise 1: All humans are mortal. Premise 2: Socrates is a human. Conclusion: Socrates is mortal. This kind of reasoning, where one fact leads\nto another, is called entailment. Once we know that all humans are mortal, and that\nSocrates is a human, those facts entail that Socrates is mortal. Deduction begins with the general \u2013 in this\ncase, what we know about human mortality \u2013 and reasons down to the specific \u2013 Socrates\nin particular. What\u2019s great about deductive arguments is\nthat the truth of the premises must lead to the truth of the conclusion. When this happens, we say that the argument\nis valid \u2013 there\u2019s just no way for the conclusion to be false if the premises are\ntrue. Now check out this argument: All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human.\nTherefore, Socrates was Plato\u2019s teacher That argument is invalid, because nothing about human\nmortality can prove that Socrates was Plato\u2019s teacher. As you might have noticed, there are plenty\nof mortal humans who never taught Plato. What\u2019s interesting, though, is that this\nargument does happen to have a true conclusion, which leads us to another issue. And that\nis: Validity is not the same as truth. All \u2018valid\u2019 really means is that if the premises\nare true, then your conclusion can\u2019t be false. But that doesn\u2019t mean that your\npremises prove your conclusion to be correct. Like, in the case of whether Socrates was\nPlato\u2019s teacher, the premises are true, and the conclusion is true, but the argument\nis still not valid -- because the premises don\u2019t in any way prove the conclusion. It\njust happens to be true. So, if your premises don\u2019t guarantee the truth of your\nconclusion, then you can end up with some really crappy arguments. Like this one:\n- All cats are mammals - I\u2019m a mammal\n- Therefore, I\u2019m a cat As much as part of me would like to be my\ncat, this is invalid because the conclusion doesn\u2019t entail from the premises\u2026at all. I mean, all cats are mammals, but all mammals\naren\u2019t cats. Which means there are such things as non-cat mammals, which I am just\none example of. And it probably goes without saying, but you can\nhave a perfectly valid argument and still have a false conclusion, if any of your premises are false.\nFor example:  - All humans have tails - My brother John is a human\n- Therefore, John Green has a tail! The argument is totally valid! \u2013 Because the premises\nentail the conclusion! The reasoning totally stands up! It\u2019s just that one of the premises is flawed. Since I\u2019m reasonably certain that John doesn\u2019t\nhave a tail -- I\u2019ve seen him in a bathing",
    "smry_text": "A well-reasoned approach dictates governing control, especially regarding human behavior. Plato, known for his three-part soul theory, proposed rational reasoning as central to humanity's essence and a source of good judgment, while acknowledging some inherent limitations. \n\nThe debate on the existence of  'better humans' persists but understanding basic needs like physical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments proves relevant in philosophy today. For this reason, applying philosophical principles to real-life situations is crucial.  Philosophical puzzles encourage exploration of critical thinking and reasoning abilities as a practical exercise. \n\nBertrand Russell introduced a paradox questioning self-shaving. This scenario underscores how logic requires the premise and conclusion to be true for the argument\u2019s validity to hold. A deductive, logical process can lead to conclusions supported by premises; therefore, truth is reflected in conclusions from this perspective.  \nThis applies even though sometimes \"true\" doesn't guarantee accuracy; as seen with a scenario of historical claims not necessarily proving a fact. The debate on valid versus true arguments remains vital to the success of philosophical study as well as everyday life.\n\nWhile validity signifies that premises must lead to conclusions, it does not inherently prove factual validity, nor does an incomplete argument demonstrate truth. There are other types of reasoning, including deductive and inductive methods; for example, in a simple \u201cAll cats are mammals\u201d statement leading to a conclusion like \"I am a mammal,\" the deductive argument is valid since the premises provide a basis; but these premises don\u2019t necessarily provide true information about humans, making the final conclusion invalid.  \nFinally, a flaw of any premise will often lead to an unfulfilled, unsupported argument that doesn't support its intended conclusion, even if all the premises follow logically in a system designed for deduction or inductive reasoning.\n\nFor instance, stating \u201cAll cats are mammals\" followed by \u201cTherefore, I am a cat,\u201d is simply an invalid, flawed logical argument because it asserts something to be true based solely on the premise's nature; they\u2019re independent realities that don't imply their connection or consequence. \nWhile a deduction like this one may hold some truth in philosophy, it shouldn't necessarily equate to actual reality.\n",

    "smry_text": "The video discusses Russell's barbershop paradox where it analyzes a scenario involving a barber that conforms to strict rules: all men must be clean-shaven and the barber follows those rules except in a situation when he can shave himself or when a man shaves himself, which creates a logical problem about whether the barber is a member of this group. \n\nRussell illustrated this dilemma by using these rules as an example for deductive reasoning: \"All humans are mortal.\"\n\"Socrates is a human.\u201d  \n\nThen it shows how deduction works by drawing conclusions that follow logically from those premises, in cases such as deductively proving the truth of Socrates\u2019 mortal status. \nBut there's a difference between validity of an argument and its truth. Validity refers to whether or not the premises guarantee a true conclusion; here the statement \"All cats are mammals - I\u2019m a mammal \u2013 Therefore, I'm a cat\" is invalid.\n\n\nThis video also discussed about sound, good reason, and how they can be found in various forms of arguments:\n\n* **Deductive reasoning** This type of argument uses general statements to support specific conclusions, as seen in the barbershop paradox. \n* Other Forms of Reasoning: Although valuable, deduction has limitations due to a need for certain premises being true, which are often difficult to come by.\n\n\nThe episode concludes that although these types of logic and argumentation are important tools for thinking, they' re just a part of something much larger \u2013 the ability of someone to reason through arguments in a thorough manner. \n",
    "clean_text": "In 20th century Britain, philosophical pioneer Bertrand Russell introduced a thought experiment showcasing analytic philosophy's essence. Consider a town with a law requiring all men to be clean-shaven. Here's the scenario: A lone barber operates under two strict rules: Rule one states that he must shave every man not shaving himself, and rule two prohibits him from shaving anyone who does choose to shave.  This peculiar predicament is akin to a nightmare for libertarians and moustachioed hipsters. However, here lies a question: Does the barber shave himself? The logic of this scenario rests on its foundation as Russell aimed to illustrate that groups have strict membership criteria.\n\nHere's how it works: \"all men who shave themselves\" must encompass every member within that group, including the barber. If the rule contradicts him shaving himself, he doesn't; if he chooses to not do so then the barber is compelled by law. In either case, logic necessitates the groups are all members of themselves. If the barber exists but violates his own rules and does shave themself,  logic fails, rendering the group\u2019s existence flawed. \n\nRussell used this puzzle to demonstrate that a group should never contain someone who can change its rule set, it must maintain its strict membership criteria for it to exist logically. Philosophies don't tolerate flawed logic; we instead should strive for well-grounded reasoning and sound arguments. So, how do perfect arguments in philosophy? It starts with examining the structure,  there are several kinds of arguments including deductive. The most straightforward is the deductive argument, where if your premises are true, then your conclusion must be true by a process where general knowledge leads to specialized cases.\n \nA deductive argument follows premise one (All people die) and Premise two (Socrates was a person) and thusly, Conclusion Socrates was Mortal as it follows a strict line of reasoning between all humans will die so therefore Socrates is mortally as well\n\nHowever the logic of deduction is valid as the premise of its being always true. It doesn\u2019t mean your argument proves your conclusion right or valid because there may be fallacies in the structure of the conclusion, as demonstrated with the incorrect example:\n \n \"All cats are mammals- I am a mammal. Therefore, I am a cat.\" The logic is clear as all cats are mammals but not all mammals are cats.  \n\n\n A sound argument is one where its premises are entirely true or accurate so that their results are guaranteed to be valid and sound. This is deductivism and it guarantees to the end the correct result. Sound deduction is something most find challenging in real-life but they can learn it by observing these examples of logic to improve their own skills\n\n The key takeaways from this journey were sound arguments, the structure of arguments, and the power of deduction. We will further explore more types of arguments as we go through each chapter next week's episodes. \nHowever, today we talked about rationality in terms of reasoning and structure and it\u2019s an important part of philosophy.

    "text": " And if the barber is a logical impossibility,\nthen he can\u2019t exist, which means the reasoning behind his existence is inherently flawed. And philosophy doesn\u2019t tolerate flawed reasoning. So, how do we make sure that we\u2019re ruled\nby good, sound, not-flawed reason? By perfecting the art of the argument. An argument, in philosophy, isn\u2019t just a\nshouting match. Instead, philosophers maintain that your beliefs\nshould always be backed up by reasons, which we call premises. Premises form the structure of your argument.\nThey offer evidence for your belief, and you can have as many premises as you like, as\nlong as they support your conclusion, which is the thing that you actually believe. So, let\u2019s dissect the anatomy of an argument. There are actually several different species\nof arguments. Probably the most familiar, and the easiest to carry out, is the deductive\nargument. The main rule of a deductive arguments is: if your\npremises are true, then your conclusion must be true. And knowing that something is actually true\nis very rare, and awesome. So, here\u2019s a boiled-down version of a good\ndeductive argument: Premise 1: All humans are mortal. Premise 2: Socrates is a human. Conclusion: Socrates is mortal. This kind of reasoning, where one fact leads\nto another, is called entailment. Once we know that all humans are mortal, and that\nSocrates is a human, those facts entail that Socrates is mortal. Deduction begins with the general \u2013 in this\ncase, what we know about human mortality \u2013 and reasons down to the specific \u2013 Socrates\nin particular. What\u2019s great about deductive arguments is\nthat the truth of the premises must lead to the truth of the conclusion. When this happens, we say that the argument\nis valid \u2013 there\u2019s just no way for the conclusion to be false if the premises are\ntrue. Now check out this argument: All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human.\nTherefore, Socrates was Plato\u2019s teacher That argument is invalid, because nothing about human\nmortality can prove that Socrates was Plato\u2019s teacher. As you might have noticed, there are plenty\nof mortal humans who never taught Plato. What\u2019s interesting, though, is that this\nargument does happen to have a true conclusion, which leads us to another issue. And that\nis: Validity is not the same as truth. All \u2018valid\u2019 really means is that if the premises\nare true, then your conclusion can\u2019t be false. But that doesn\u2019t mean that your\npremises prove your conclusion to be correct. Like, in the case of whether Socrates was\nPlato\u2019s teacher, the premises are true, and the conclusion is true, but the argument\nis still not valid -- because the premises don\u2019t in any way prove the conclusion. It\njust happens to be true. So, if your premises don\u2019t guarantee the truth of your\nconclusion, then you can end up with some really crappy arguments. Like this one:\n- All cats are mammals - I\u2019m a mammal\n- Therefore, I\u2019m a cat As much as part of me would like to be my\ncat, this is invalid because the conclusion doesn\u2019t entail from the premises\u2026at all. I mean, all cats are mammals, but all mammals\naren\u2019t cats. Which means there are such things as non-cat mammals, which I am just\none example of. And it probably goes without saying, but you can\nhave a perfectly valid argument and still have a false conclusion, if any of your premises are false.\nFor example:  - All humans have tails - My brother John is a human\n- Therefore, John Green has a tail! The argument is totally valid! \u2013 Because the premises\nentail the conclusion! The reasoning totally stands up! It\u2019s just that one of the premises is flawed. Since I\u2019m reasonably certain that John doesn\u2019t\nhave a tail -- I\u2019ve seen him in a bathing suit -- this argument is not deductively sound. And a deductively sound argument is one that\u2019s\nfree of formal flaws or defects. It\u2019s an argument whose premises are all\ntrue, and that\u2019s valid, which means its conclusion is guaranteed to be true. So, sound arguments should always be your\ngoal. The reason that deduction is prized by philosophers\n-- and lots of other important kinds of thinkers -- is that it\u2019s the only kind of argument\nthat can give you a real certainty. But it\u2019s limited, because it only works if you\u2019re starting\nwith known, true premises, which are hard to come by. And for what it\u2019s worth, deductive truths\nare usually pretty obvious. They don\u2019t tend to lead us to startlingly new information, like the fact\nthat I\u2019m not a cat, or that John doesn\u2019t have a tail. So instead of starting with premises that\nare already certain, like deduction does, you\u2019re gonna have to know how to determine\nthe truth of, and your confidence in, your premises. Which means you\u2019re going to have to acquaint\nyourself with the other species of arguments, which we\u2019re gonna do next time. But today, we talked about the value of reason,\nthe structure of arguments, and we took a close look at one kind of argument: deductive\nreasoning.

    "smry_text": "<h2>Argument Structure & Deductive Reasoning</h2>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n\n* **Philosophical Argument:** The process of constructing and defending claims based on reasoning. \n* **Premise(s):**  Statements providing evidence or reasons supporting the conclusion. Premise's must be true to yield a valid argument. \n* **Conclusion:** The claim being asserted, based on the truth of the premises.\n* **Deductive Argument:** A type of logical reasoning where if the premises are true, the conclusion is guaranteed to be true.\n  \n### Deductive Reasoning\n\n* **Entailment in deduction:**  The relationship between premises and their conclusion, where following each premise leads to a certainty about the ultimate conclusion.\n    * Example: All human are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Valid deduction - Premises = Truth)\n    \n* **Validity versus Truth:** Validity is the structure of an argument; if the premises are actually true and follow logically, then the conclusion must be valid. \n    * A Valid but False Conclusion: For example, \"All cats are mammals\" + \"I'm a mammal\" \u2192 \"Therefore, I\u2019m a cat.\" - If premise (all cats are mammals) is false, the conclusion becomes invalid even though it logically follows from the premises.\n\n  * **Truth Defenses:** It is vital to have true premises before attempting deductive reasoning--and if your premises lack truth, you will not prove valid argument conclusions.\n\n\n### Limitations & Example of Invalid Arguments \n* **Non-deductive arguments:**  Often more prevalent than deductive and can be based on observations, hypotheses, or personal experience..  \n* **False Premises:** \"All cats have tails.\" + The claim that John has a tail = a false conclusion.\n\n\n<h3>Importance of Valid Arguments**\n\nValid but faulty conclusions: \"I'm a cat,\" + Premise \"All cats are mammals\" \n     - It's a valid deduction and it sounds compelling,  though the premises aren\u2019t inherently true - It's a case of seemingly solid reasoning; but there is no guarantee to its truth (validity alone does not mean accuracy).\n\n***Note:** A strong argument hinges on validity and sound logic. The structure of an argument matters: if it follows logical chains without false premises, it can be reliable. For example, \"All cats are mammals\" + \"I'm a mammal\", therefore\u2026 \n       - This is a valid deduction but the conclusion may need truth to back it up\u2014like, it may not hold when compared to cats with short legs and no whiskers. (If you have short legs, do you qualify as cat?)\n\n\n###  Moving Forward\n\nTo delve deeper into these philosophical arguments, we will explore other argument types next time!  \n \n **Note:** This transcript is designed for clear comprehension, however philosophical and academic language has been used to avoid ambiguity.",

Like this one: - All cats are mammals - I'm a mammal. This leads to the conclusion: If all mammals have fur, then I must have fur. Therefore I am a cat. Conclusion: No, not a cat.  So why do we continue trying to create the \u201cdeductive\u201d conclusion? Because there are very few other types of arguments in use that work this way, or that seem to be able to deliver the same type of certainty. This is not because those guarantees are always true, but instead they are something that can become useful when used in a way that is careful and deliberate; like deduction. So it will help to look at this through some questions. For example: \nCan's deducing make any other kind of truth? \n\nIt only gives us certainty based on premises that are true, so how do we come up with those beforehand. What about using our skills to build better arguments and try to use a more complex method when building an argument; or even just the type of skill used in scientific argumentation?\n\nThe main point for all these kinds of thought is to think very intentionally and deeply, and to understand the nature of truth better. \n\n\n",
