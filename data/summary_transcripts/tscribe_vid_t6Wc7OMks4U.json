The story of the Sistine Chapel doesn\u2019t\u00a0\nactually begin with Michelangelo,\u00a0\u00a0 but with a wealthy Italian\u00a0\nfamily called the Medicis. The Medicis ruled Florence and, later,\u00a0\nTuscany, from the 15th to the 18th centuries. They also controlled the what, where,\u00a0\nand how of the local art scene.

    "smry_text": "Biombo: A Folding Screen  \nJapanese design, dating back centuries, this biombo tells a story through its decorative elements. The screen's rich history is evident; it served as decor in a wealthy Spanish home during the late 17th century.\n\nThe Biombo as Symbol\nHistorical events like Spanish conquest of Tenochtitlan are often presented differently based on the primary source, artwork, or document examined.  Native accounts and records offer differing stories, highlighting the complexity of historical documentation. Learning about this biombo helps us understand the multifaceted nature of history itself. \n\nThe Craft of Interpreting the Past\nThis video explores art in connection with history, examining objects like the biombo as a tool to learn about different perspectives and narratives. Art represents cultural influences, ideas, and individual experiences. The discussion also expands on how art's interpretation varies across cultures, referencing indigenous classifications from modern Congo tribes.\n\nThe Subjectivity of Art\nArt holds power through varied mediums\u2014from ancient cave paintings to modern-day works. Art can evoke feelings, ignite inspiration, or inspire dissent, all depending on the viewer\u2019s perspective and personal experience. \n\nDefining Art Through Time\nArt, especially how we define it throughout history, has evolved across cultures, languages, and time periods. This evolution reflects cultural values, beliefs, and societal shifts impacting artistic definition, language, and interpretations. For example, the word \"art\" itself might seem ambiguous across different cultures as some may use alternative terms entirely for 'art'.\n\n\nThe Sistine Chapel: A Symbol of Renaissance\nThis video delves into the history of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, exploring how such famous artworks intersect with larger historical context to inspire and guide art historians. \n\nEarly Influences In Art History\nPrevalent in ancient cultures like Plato and Aristotle's writings about the nature of reality, artists long recognized and engaged with art as a form of expression aimed at mimicking aspects of the real world. Notably, Zhang Yanyuan's work from the ninth century \"Famous Paintings\" serves as testament to this enduring fascination for the power and essence of art in ancient times \n\nThe Evolution of Art History\nArt historians have been working for centuries to decipher, categorize, and share information about various historical artworks through the years. From the Renaissance period's Vasari's book \u201cLives of the Most Excellent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\u201d to contemporary scholars exploring the influence of art in society and culture\u2014the craft of researching and studying these works continues to evolve with each generation. \n",

    "smry_text": "### Crash Course Art History: Unveiling art's Past and Present\n\nThis introduction delves into the history of art through the lens of art history, exploring how objects tell stories. It aims to debunk popular misconceptions about the field. \n\n**The Purpose of Art History:** \n\nArt history transcends a dusty subject solely used for trivia nights.  Instead, it encourages critical observation and analysis, unveiling insights on historical context and people behind artworks.  Understanding different perspectives and narratives within art reveals underlying ideas across cultures and time periods. \n\n **Defining Art:** \nThe word \"art\" carries nuanced ideas, encompassing diverse expressions from ancient cave paintings to modern street art. Its subjective nature makes it a personal phenomenon, with each individual's interpretation shaping meaning. Additionally, the concept of what constitutes art has varied throughout time and cultures. Some may even question the existence of art, viewing any material representation as mere \"heavy things\" rather than a form of artistic expression. Examples provided are the Lega people's definition of \"masengo,\" which refers to objects of deep significance.  This demonstrates how cultural contexts shape understanding. \n\n**Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel:**\n The famous \"Sistine Chapel Ceiling painted by Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni\" exemplifies a significant artistic era, shaped by the Medici family's substantial influence over Italian artistry. This impactful artwork fueled a Renaissance period, where art flourished under patronage:\n   * **Origins of Art History:**  Instead of an abrupt start in the 5th century B.C.E., art history started with Plato and Aristotle who examined imitation of reality through works like \"Famous Paintings of Successive Dynasties\" written as early as the 9th century C.E and later developed by historian Zhang Yanyuan, the oldest comprehensive record of Chinese painting history to exist.   \n* **The Legacy of Vasari:** \n Giorgio Vasari's extensive biographies contributed significantly to shaping what we call art history today: \n    * His biographical series cemented its framework: artists and artworks deemed \"worthy\" were showcased prominently, becoming the cornerstone for Western-centric interpretations. \n    * While this canon evolved through centuries, Vasari\u2019s work created a template of art's development based on specific Western European examples.\n\n**Establishing Personal Artistic Canon:**\n The course invites viewers to challenge the established canon through Sarah Urist Green's own selection process, highlighting both historical figures and artworks that deeply resonate with her:\n\n\n* **The \"Canon Cannon\":**  This highlights different artistic periods and notable contributors across history to form a more balanced, personal overview.\n\n\n\nThrough these examples and discussions about art history, this course encourages a deeper understanding of its role in shaping our cultural perspective.\n",

Not all cultures think of art the same way, or\u00a0\neven have a word for \u201cart\u201d in their language. Like, the Lega people from what\u2019s now\u00a0\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo\u00a0\u00a0 have a category of objects called\u00a0\nmasengo, which roughly translates\u00a0\u00a0 to \u201cheavy things\u201d and refers to items\u00a0\nwith great significance or \u201cweight.\u201d As for you, when you hear \u201cart history,\u201d\u00a0\nyou might think of something like this. Whoops, sorry, I meant, this: The\u00a0\nwell-known Sistine Chapel ceiling,\u00a0\u00a0 painted by Michelangelo di\u00a0\nLodovico Buonarroti Simoni. No clue why we call him by his first name. But let\u2019s explore why that ceiling\u00a0\ncomes to mind when you think about art,\u00a0\u00a0 and why you\u2019ve heard of the guy who painted it. Let\u2019s go to the drawing board! The story of the Sistine Chapel doesn\u2019t\u00a0\nactually begin with Michelangelo,\u00a0\u00a0 but with a wealthy Italian\u00a0\nfamily called the Medicis. The Medicis ruled Florence and, later,\u00a0\nTuscany, from the 15th to the 18th centuries. They also controlled the what, where,\u00a0\nand how of the local art scene. They financially supported several\u00a0\nhuge artists\u2014including Michelangelo. So with the Medici Brand behind him, Michelangelo\u00a0\nwas basically one of Italy\u2019s biggest influencers. He even caught the eye of Pope Julius\u00a0\nthe Second, who commissioned him to\u00a0\u00a0 paint the now famous Sistine Chapel ceiling. Now, the Medicis were also sponsors of the\u00a0\npainter and architect Giorgio Vasari, who\u00a0\u00a0 wrote a book called \u201cLives of the Most Excellent\u00a0\nItalian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.\u201d It celebrated Michelangelo\u00a0\nand other artists like him,\u00a0\u00a0 and it gave the Medicis credit for\u00a0\nsupporting a historic, quote, \u201crebirth.\u201d In fact, before the French term \u201cRenaissance\u201d\u00a0\nbecame prominent in the 19th century,\u00a0\u00a0 Vasari described this artistic moment in time as\u00a0\n\u201crinascita\u201d\u2014 Italian for \u201crenewal\u201d or \u201crebirth.\u201d So yeah, the book was basically\u00a0\nsixteenth-century sponsored content,\u00a0\u00a0 and it became the bedrock of\u00a0\nwhat we know now as art history. It shaped not only the way\u00a0\nart history would be written,\u00a0\u00a0 but which artworks were considered important,\u00a0\ntalked about, and eventually meme-ified. Of course, writing about art\u00a0\ndidn\u2019t start with Vasari. By the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E.,\u00a0\nPlato was wrestling with art\u2019s imitation\u00a0\u00a0 of reality in his writings, and Aristotle\u00a0\nwas exploring how art can conjure emotions. And in the ninth century, Zhang Yanyuan\u00a0\nwrote \u201cFamous Paintings of Successive\u00a0\u00a0 Dynasties,\u201d the oldest comprehensive written\u00a0\nhistory of Chinese painting known to exist. So, there\u2019s evidence of art historical\u00a0\nwritings throughout the world,\u00a0\u00a0 and through much of recorded history. But Vasari\u2019s series of biographies strongly\u00a0\nshaped how the story of art would be told\u00a0\u00a0 from then on, with a significant\u00a0\nbias toward Western European art. It was this text that became the basis of\u00a0\nwhat is called the canon of art history:\u00a0\u00a0 a collection or timeline of artists and\u00a0\nartworks believed to be truly great,\u00a0\u00a0 to have furthered art\u2019s progress,\u00a0\nthat get talked about again and again. So, yeah, who's in the canon and\u00a0\nwho's out is pretty arbitrary! And because this is my series \u2014\u00a0\nand I don't think Vasari's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 mind \u2014 allow me to introduce.... my canon cannon. With its help, I, according to my own whims,\u00a0\u00a0 will launch people into my\u00a0\npersonal canon of beloved artists. And you better watch out, Gauguin,\u00a0\nI may also kick a few out, too. Many of Vasari\u2019s chosen artists\u00a0\nbecame known as the Old Masters,\u00a0\u00a0 a kind of legendary status that later\u00a0\nartists needed to measure up to. Over time, art history continued to\u00a0\nevolve, and the canon of greats grew\u00a0\u00a0 to include new masterpieces and\u00a0\nmakers, and forgot about others. By the eighteenth century, artworks began\u00a0\nto be sorted by style, or groupings based\u00a0\u00a0 on time periods, creators, or\u00a0\nelements of their appearance. With that sorting came new ways of judging,\u00a0\u00a0 explaining, and interpreting art,\u00a0\nthrough the field of art criticism. And by the mid-twentieth-century, race, class,\u00a0\nand gender became recognized as important lenses\u00a0\u00a0 through which to examine art, both in terms\u00a0\nof who made it and who is looking at it. So, today, art historians analyze images\u00a0\nand materials from multiple angles to\u00a0\u00a0 explore what they can tell us about each other,\u00a0\nourselves, and the cultures that connect us.

    "smry_text": "The story of the Sistine Chapel begins before Michelangelo, with the Medici family who wielded power over Florence and Tuscan art for centuries. The Medici financially supported prominent artists like Michelangelo.  They secured commissions and ensured his fame, making him one of Italy's most influential figures. \n\nOne individual significantly impacted the history of art was Giorgio Vasari, whose book \"Lives of the Most Excellent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\" shaped how art was documented. Though sponsored content, it became a defining text influencing how art is studied and considered historically important. Vasari's works influenced the formation of an artist-focused canon which remains influential today and can be viewed as having impacted how we understand art history.\n\nAs early as the 5th century B.C.E., philosophers like Plato wrestled with art imitation, prompting exploration by Aristotle regarding how art impacts emotions. Chinese artistic influence on world histories begins with Zhang Yanyuan's \"Famous Paintings of Successive Dynasties\". Across millennia, historical writings about art began to emerge globally.  Vasari\u2019s biography helped shape how these art-related narratives were told, highlighting Western European art. \n\nThe canon of art history, which identifies specific great artists as part of Western tradition and those who stand out based on artistic merit, became established by Vasari's influence. This concept has been both challenged and debated amongst art historians in the present day.  Art historian's work today requires us to look at multiple angles when exploring art and considers elements of race, class, and gender, which are vital in analyzing art\u2019s impact and significance. \n\nThrough analysis across diverse perspectives, these historical narratives help connect art history through cultural context. An contemporary example is Kara Walker's \"Fons Americanus,\" inspired by monuments showcasing British colonial influence in Africa and the Americas. This piece reflects on a differing narrative often missing in historic commemorations. \n\n\n\n",

It was this text that became the basis of\u00a0\nwhat is called the canon of art history:\u00a0\u00a0 a collection or timeline of artists and\u00a0\nartworks believed to be truly great,\u00a0\u00a0 to have furthered art\u2019s progress,\u00a0\nthat get talked about again and again. So, yeah, who's in the canon and\u00a0\nwho's out is pretty arbitrary! And because this is my series \u2014\u00a0\nand I don't think Vasari's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 mind \u2014 allow me to introduce.... my canon cannon. With its help, I, according to my own whims,\u00a0\u00a0 will launch people into my\u00a0\npersonal canon of beloved artists. And you better watch out, Gauguin,\u00a0\nI may also kick a few out, too. Many of Vasari\u2019s chosen artists\u00a0\nbecame known as the Old Masters,\u00a0\u00a0 a kind of legendary status that later\u00a0\nartists needed to measure up to. Over time, art history continued to\u00a0\nevolve, and the canon of greats grew\u00a0\u00a0 to include new masterpieces and\u00a0\nmakers, and forgot about others. By the eighteenth century, artworks began\u00a0\nto be sorted by style, or groupings based\u00a0\u00a0 on time periods, creators, or\u00a0\nelements of their appearance. With that sorting came new ways of judging,\u00a0\u00a0 explaining, and interpreting art,\u00a0\nthrough the field of art criticism. And by the mid-twentieth-century, race, class,\u00a0\nand gender became recognized as important lenses\u00a0\u00a0 through which to examine art, both in terms\u00a0\nof who made it and who is looking at it. So, today, art historians analyze images\u00a0\nand materials from multiple angles to\u00a0\u00a0 explore what they can tell us about each other,\u00a0\nourselves, and the cultures that connect us. Studying art helps us understand\u00a0\nhistory as a constructed account,\u00a0\u00a0 something that\u2019s built in its telling. And it helps us remember that our\u00a0\nown perspectives are always limited. The more we learn about how\u00a0\nother people see the world,\u00a0\u00a0 the better we understand\u2026pretty much everything. Like, here\u2019s an artwork by Kara Walker, where\u00a0\none account of history confronts another. It\u2019s called \u201cFons Americanus,\u201d\u2014\u201cAmerican Fountain\u201d\u00a0\nin Latin\u2014and it\u2019s inspired by the Victoria\u00a0\u00a0 Memorial in London, a monument celebrating\u00a0\nthe British Empire under Queen Victoria. The Victoria Memorial tells a triumphant story\u00a0\nabout colonial rule in Africa and the Americas. But Walker\u2019s monument tells another\u00a0\npart of the story from a different view. A weeping boy and a noose hanging from a tree,\u00a0\nfor example, give voice to the unspoken parts\u00a0\u00a0 of the Victoria Memorial: the human toll\u00a0\nof colonial violence and enslavement. As Walker\u2019s work shows us, it\u2019s as important to\u00a0\nthink about what isn\u2019t included in art as what is. And the same goes for history. So, yeah, let\u2019s launch her right into the canon. And often, what is remembered comes\u00a0\ndown to what materials have survived. Take this painting: \u201cThe Raft of the Medusa,\u201d\u00a0\npainted by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault in 1819. It\u2019s a massive artwork that\u00a0\ntells an even bigger story. In 1816, a French ship set\u00a0\noff for the coast of Senegal,\u00a0\u00a0 captained by a pal of King Louis the 18th,\u00a0\nwho hadn\u2019t been at sea in twenty years. The results were disastrous: the captain wrecked\u00a0\nthe ship, which didn\u2019t have enough lifeboats,\u00a0\u00a0 so the crew cobbled together a raft\u00a0\nto carry the remaining passengers. About 150 people were set adrift on\u00a0\nthe makeshift vessel, and during the\u00a0\u00a0 next thirteen days at sea, they fought,\u00a0\nkilled, and even resorted to cannibalism.",
    "smry_text": "Art history has roots in ancient traditions: scholars from Plato's time through Zhang Yanyuan's works all documented art. Vasari's biographies heavily influenced how art was studied until his 'sixteenth-century sponsored content,' creating a foundation for our understanding of art history. This led to the development of a \"canon,\" comprising artists and artworks considered truly great, with further contributions enriching it over time.\n\nA notable example is the canonization of \"Old Masters,\" artists whose work set a benchmark for succeeding generations. Over time, art history broadened its perspective, incorporating new masterpieces and challenging pre-established canon beliefs. Art criticism emerged as a dedicated area to explore how and why art is judged and interpreted. \n\n\nThe mid-twentieth century saw the crucial introduction of race, class, and gender as significant viewpoints through which to analyze art's production and reception. This multidisciplinary approach further reshaped the field of art history. Contemporary artists continue to challenge the limits of 'Western Art History,' pushing for a more inclusive perspective by exploring the untold stories embedded in their subjects.\n\nArtists have been able to bring forth diverse voices and perspectives, as exemplified by Kara Walker's \"Fons Americanus\". Her artwork confronts differing perceptions of history, challenging existing narratives that often depict colonial rule from a biased perspective. The study of art allows us to understand both its history as reflected in the subject matter itself and the limitations of our own perspectives.\n\nWe delve deeper into the canvas with examples such as Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's \"The Raft of the Medusa,\" an iconic artwork reflecting a real historical event. In 1816, a disastrous voyage led to widespread panic among French crew members who attempted self-preservation, leading to a dramatic escape in a doomed attempt for survival across multiple days at sea. The narrative surrounding this shipwreck serves as an example of historical narratives. It also underlines how art can encapsulate the stories behind forgotten and often misunderstood events that shape our understanding and perception of history itself.   \n",

    "smry_text": "Art history is built upon written descriptions dating back to ancient times. Vasari's writings significantly influenced the trajectory of art history by highlighting Western European art with a bias towards those artists from the past and forming what we call the \"canon of art history\" \u2013  a collection of influential artistic masterpieces believed to advance art and be remembered in discussions about art. \n\nThe canon has evolved significantly over time, often influenced by changes in taste, new discoveries, and different understandings of art's value. A shift emerged from categorizing artists and artworks based on style and period, leading to the development of Art criticism during this period, focusing on examining the subject at hand.  Throughout the 20th century, social changes like race, class, and gender began contributing factors to art analysis as it provided new perspectives for discussing the process of making art.\n\n\nThe analysis of art allows for greater understanding not just how things are made but also how history itself is constructed. Studying materials helps expand these analyses by considering different perspectives on what's left behind, such as a work from the 18th century by Kara Walker called \"Fons Americanus,\" which challenges the historical narrative presented in the Victoria Memorial statue - offering an alternative and unsettling view of colonial rule, slavery and its lasting impact. This highlights that it is not only important to consider what is included, but also about which aspects are absent. A classic example is Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault' \"The Raft of the Medusa\" (1819) \u2014 a painting of a tragic tale involving a French ship in distress.  The story documented through sketches, drafts, and historical records allowed G\u00e9ricault to paint such an emotionally devastating piece of art, yet many interpretations occurred due to the controversial representation of the historical event involving the involvement of the French King. \n\nThere are cases where artwork survived for centuries \u2014 as was evident in this famous painting from 1819\u2013\"The Raft of the Medusa.\"  Sometimes, even the artists' working methods and responses can offer crucial insight to these materials\u2019 provenance. For example, materials often provide the history of an artwork \u2014 like our \u201cdrum,\u201d which remains a mystery about who made it when, is an illustration of the challenges in accessing art and preserving it over time.\n\n \n",

The results were disastrous: the captain wrecked\u00a0\nthe ship, which didn\u2019t have enough lifeboats,\u00a0\u00a0 so the crew cobbled together a raft\u00a0\nto carry the remaining passengers. About 150 people were set adrift on\u00a0\nthe makeshift vessel, and during the\u00a0\u00a0 next thirteen days at sea, they fought,\u00a0\nkilled, and even resorted to cannibalism. When rescue finally arrived,\u00a0\nonly fifteen survivors remained,\u00a0\u00a0 with five more dying before ever seeing land. It took G\u00e9ricault over a year to paint the scene,\u00a0\u00a0 which we know from documents that have survived:\u00a0\nsketches, drafts, and letters about his work. He interviewed survivors of the\u00a0\nMedusa, drew their portraits,\u00a0\u00a0 and consulted a book that two of\u00a0\nthem wrote about what happened. And he wrestled with how to paint it,\u00a0\u00a0 arranging the scene until he was\u00a0\nsatisfied with the story it would tell. We even know how the work\u00a0\nwas received by the public. At the time, opinions on the French monarchy\u00a0\nranged widely, so when G\u00e9ricault depicted\u00a0\u00a0 a tragedy caused by the king\u2019s incompetent\u00a0\nleadership, many interpreted that as a sick burn. The point is: We know so much\u00a0\nabout this one painting because\u00a0\u00a0 lots of material evidence about it has\u00a0\nsurvived the past two hundred years. But that\u2019s not the case for so many other works. Like this drum, which sits in the British Museum. We don\u2019t know exactly who made it or when. What little we know right\u00a0\nnow is from museum records,\u00a0\u00a0 which say an Irish scientist procured the\u00a0\ndrum in Virginia in the early 18th century. The museum labeled it an American\u00a0\nIndian drum made of a hollowed tree. Then, over 150 years later,\u00a0\u00a0 an anthropologist noticed it looked\u00a0\na lot like drums made in West Africa. But it took about seventy more years\u00a0\nbefore researchers figured out the\u00a0\u00a0 drum was made of wood from a\u00a0\nWest African species of tree. It\u2019s likely that someone from the Akan\u00a0\nculture, in what\u2019s now Ghana, made the drum. In its original context, it would have\u00a0\nbeen played as part of a whole ensemble. But at some point, the drum probably ended\u00a0\nup on a ship from Africa to North America. We have stacks of information to help\u00a0\nus understand \u201cThe Raft of the Medusa.\u201d But with the drum, we\u2019re piecing\u00a0\ntogether a story from scraps. Artifacts like these show\u00a0\nus how much what survives\u00a0\u00a0 our history shapes our understanding of it. But the flip side is also true: the\u00a0\nmore we uncover what\u2019s been lost,\u00a0\u00a0",
    "smry_text": "Many artists achieved legendary status, and were referenced by future generations as \"Old Masters\". Art history evolved to include new masterpieces and creators while forgetting others. \n\nThe categorization and analysis of artworks by style or time periods led to a formal field of art criticism. In the mid-20th century, racial, social class, and gender became recognized lenses for analyzing art's creation, including its audiences.  Scholars examine images and materials from multiple perspectives to gain more understanding about each other, themselves, and diverse cultures.\n\nArt provides insight into historical accounts being constructed as a product of their telling and the self-limited perspectives we all hold.   Through art history, studying these constructions allows us to better understand how culture shapes our view of the world. \n\n\nThe works of Kara Walker demonstrate an approach to understanding contrasting historical narrative. Her \"Fons Americanus\" (American Fountain), inspired by London\u2019s Victoria Memorial, presents a unique interpretation of colonial rule and oppression. Comparing traditional depictions with her work highlights the silenced stories of African history often overlooked in imperial narratives. Through art, exploring marginalized voices allows us to gain deeper understanding about these untold stories.\n\nThe Raft of the Medusa by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault serves as a key example for understanding how the surviving records can be used to analyze art's context and purpose. The painting was based on multiple sources of documentation provided by survivors. G\u00e9ricault's meticulous approach in depicting this historical scenario through art provides insight into his creative process, revealing aspects such as public reception at the time that reflect the political climate.  \n\nMaterial evidence plays a crucial role in understanding specific works while the lack thereof reveals the limitations of studying many artistic elements from a historical perspective (such as this drum found in the British Museum). Studying these limited artifacts like artifacts allows us to see how our current understanding is shaped by available information and understand its evolution.  By seeking out missing pieces of history, we continually revise our approach to reconstructing past events using evidence found.\n",
    "clean_text": "Many of Vasari's chosen artists became known as the Old Masters, a kind of legendary status that later artists needed to measure up to. Over time, art history continued to evolve, and the canon of greats grew to include new masterpieces and makers. However, artworks began to be sorted by style, or groupings based on time periods, creators, or elements of their appearance. With this sorting came new ways of judging, explaining, and interpreting art through the field of art criticism. By the mid-twentieth century, race, class, and gender became recognized as important lenses through which to examine art, in terms of who made it and who was looking at it. Thus, today, art historians analyze images and materials from multiple angles to explore what they can tell us about each other, ourselves, and the cultures that connect us. Studying art helps us understand history as a constructed account\u2014something built during its telling. It also helps us remember that our own perspectives are always limited; as such, the more we learn about how others see the world, the better we understand pretty much everything.  For instance, here's an artwork by Kara Walker, where one account of history confronts another. It\u2019s called \"Fons Americanus\"\u2014\u201cAmerican Fountain\u201d\u2014and it's inspired by the Victoria Memorial in London, a monument celebrating the British Empire under Queen Victoria.  The Victoria Memorial tells a triumphant story about colonial rule in Africa and the Americas. However, Walker\u2019s monument presents another part of the story from a different perspective. A weeping boy and a noose hanging from a tree, for example, give voice to the unspoken parts of the Victoria Memorial: the human toll of colonial violence and enslavement. As Walker's work shows us, it\u2019s just as significant to consider what isn\u2019t included in art as what is included. And this holds true for history. Therefore, let\u2019s include her in the canon. Furthermore, the things that are generally remembered tend to stem from which materials have survived. Take, for example, this painting \"The Raft of the Medusa\", painted by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault in 1819. It's a massive artwork with a significant story. In 1816, a French ship set off for the coast of Senegal, captained by a friend of King Louis the 18th, who hadn\u2019t been at sea in twenty years. The result was disastrous: the captain wrecked the ship, which didn\u2019t have enough lifeboats, so the crew cobbled together a raft to carry the remaining passengers. Around 150 people were set adrift on this makeshift vessel and during those next thirteen days at sea they fought, killed, and even resorted to cannibalism. When rescue finally arrived, only fifteen survivors remained, with five more dying before ever seeing land. It took G\u00e9ricault over a year to paint the scene, for which we know details due to documents that have survived: his sketches, drafts, letters that mention about his work. He interviewed survivors of the Medusa, drew their portraits, and consulted a book about what happened by two of them.  And he wrestled with how to depict it, arranging the scene until he was satisfied with the story it would tell. We even know how the work was received by the public at the time. As opinions on the French monarchy varied widely, when G\u00e9ricault depicted a tragedy caused directly by the king's incompetent leadership, many interpreted that as a sick burn. The point is: We know so much about this one painting due to lots of material evidence regarding it from history's past two hundred years. This isn\u2019t the case for so many other works.  Like a drum that sits in the British Museum. We don't know much of its origin or precise age, as all we really know comes from museum records showing an Irish scientist procured the drum in Virginia during the early 18th century. Then, over one-hundred and fifty years later, an anthropologist noted that it resembled drums made in West Africa. But it took about seventy more years for researchers to figure out that this drum was crafted using wood from a West African tree species. It's thought that someone from the Akan culture, or where Ghana currently is, most likely made the drum. Its intended use should have been part of an ensemble. However, at some time, it most likely ended up on a ship from Africa to North America.  These artifacts help us gain insight into our understanding of history and its construction, through fragments of the past. Yet there\u2019s also the flip side: the more we uncover what's been lost...\n",

    "smry_text": "A speaker discusses the importance of recognizing perspective diversity in historical understanding, using examples from Kara Walker's art.  \n\n**Understanding Historical Perspectives:** \nWalker's \"Fons Americanus,\" inspired by London's Victoria Memorial, presents a different narrative of history than the British colonial period. This piece confronts audiences with previously overlooked aspects of colonialism, such as the human cost of European rule. Art often highlights those that are excluded in historical narratives and this approach highlights what is not included. \n**Influence of Surviving Materials:** \nWhen analyzing artworks, understanding their materials' survival becomes key. Such survival helps illuminate stories behind famous works of art like Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's \"The Raft of the Medusa.\" This painting, based on documented research from surviving sketches and accounts of events by survivors, unveils a real-life tragedy during French maritime disaster. \n**Materials in Museums & Understanding Cultural History:**  \nExamples include the drum found at the British Museum but information is limited about its origin.  Through this type of investigation, researchers have learned about objects like the \"American Indian\" drum that was actually created by an Akan culture member from West Africa. This demonstrates how the material landscape is important to understanding our artistic history and cultural connections between different continents.\n**The Power of Art:** \nArtists reflect on social issues and use various mediums in expressing viewpoints, often uncovering new stories through art.  By studying art history, as they discuss in this Crash Course episode, viewers can analyze perspectives while exploring the interconnectivity of events over time and across cultures. \n\n **Next Episode:** \nThe speaker highlights what is covered next to help viewers understand that by closely viewing art pieces, new answers may be uncovered about its meaning beyond surface-level thoughts.

The cleaned output should be grammatically correct and not have spelling mistakes.  It must also retain all of the original phrases to remain authentic.   I won't add new information nor express opinions or suggest follow-up questions. \n\nHere is the cleaned transcript:\n\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s built into its telling, and it helps us remember our perspectives are always limited. The more we learn about how other people see the world, the better we understand... pretty much everything.  For instance here is an artwork by Kara Walker where one account of history confronts another. It's called \u201cFons Americanus,\u201d\u2014\"American Fountain\"\u2014and it is inspired by the Victoria Memorial in London, a monument celebrating the British Empire under Queen Victoria.

For example, a weeping boy and a noose hanging from a tree give voice to the unspoken parts of the Victoria Memorial: the human toll of colonial violence and enslavement. As Walker's work shows us, it\u2019s as important to think about what isn't included in art as what is. And the same goes for history.  So yes, we should launch her right into the canon. And often, what is remembered seems to come down to materials that have survived. Take this painting \u201cThe Raft of the Medusa.\u201d Painted by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault in 1819. It\u2019s a massive artwork that tells an even bigger story. In 1816 a French ship set off for the coast of Senegal, commanded by a friend who King Louis the Eighteenth, who hadn't been at sea for twenty years, and his journey went wrong when the captain wrecked the ship. The wreck resulted in fewer lifeboats, so the crew cobbled together a raft to carry the remaining passengers. Around 150 people ended up on the makeshift vessel. During those 13 days at sea: they fought, killed, and even resorted to cannibalism before rescue finally arrived, only 15 survivors remained. The total number who died after being left at sea was five more. G\u00e9ricault took over a year to paint the scene; we know from documents that survived: sketches, drafts, and letters about his work. He interviewed the survivors, drew portraits of them and consulted a book two of them wrote about what happened in more detail. And he struggled with how to depict it. Arrange until he was satisfied. We even know what the artwork\u2019s reception looked like.  At the time opinions on the French monarchy varied widely, so when G\u00e9ricault depicted a tragedy caused by the king's incompetent leadership many interpreted that as a sick burn. The point is we know a lot about this painting due to lots of material evidence from recent years. But this is not the case for so many other works, like this drum which sits in the British Museum. We don't know exactly who made it or when. What little we know now is from museum records: they state an Irish scientist procured the drum in Virginia in the early 18th century. Over 150 years later an anthropologist noticed it looked a lot like drums made in West Africa. But, it took somewhere around seventy more years for researchers to figure out that the drums were made of wood from a West African species of tree. It\u2019s likely the people from the Akan culture who resided where  Ghana is now made the drum.   In its native context, it would have been played as part of an ensemble. But at some point, the drum probably ended up on a ship from Africa to North America. We have stacks of information about what has been lost and that will help us fill in some missing stories. So throughout this series we'll explore art history, discover how art reflects different perspectives: reveals unexpected connections across time, space, and cultures.  We\u2019ll see how art-making also is meaning making, and how context can change everything we thought we knew about history. We will grapple with things like what kinds of questions it takes to build a good framework around our understanding.  Of, course of these are just some of the many questions that will emerge! Next time we\u2019ll learn exactly how to carefully look at a work of art.
