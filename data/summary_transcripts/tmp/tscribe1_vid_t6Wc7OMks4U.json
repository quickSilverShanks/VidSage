It existed before we had pianos\u00a0\nor bicycles or even sandwiches. This one would have decorated a wealthy Spaniard\u2019s\u00a0\nhome in late seventeenth-century Mexico. And while it might look like mere decoration,\u00a0\nif you lean in, it'll tell you a story. A story of a battle, where Spain conquered\u00a0\nTenochtitlan, or modern day Mexico City,\u00a0\u00a0 and the Aztec emperor Moctezuma the Second\u00a0\nwas killed by one of his own subjects. But records from the Indigenous people of\u00a0\nMexico tell a different story of the same event. In their account, the Spanish killed the\u00a0\nAztec emperor, as part of their conquest. Historical events like this \u2014 and history\u00a0\nitself \u2014 aren\u2019t exactly straightforward. The story you get varies, depending\u00a0\non which documents, or artworks,\u00a0\u00a0 you look at, and who\u2019s doing the telling. By studying this centuries-old screen we\u00a0\nlearn about more than just the object itself. We learn about history \u2014 and how history,\u00a0\u00a0 like art, is not something we\u00a0\ndiscover, but something we create. Hi! I'm Sarah Urist Green. I\u2019m a curator and art educator, and\u00a0\nthis is Crash Course Art History. You might think that art history\u00a0\nis a stuffy subject that\u2019s only\u00a0\u00a0 useful for clinching a trivia night victory. Or you might think it\u2019s just\u00a0\nmemorizing a bunch of names and dates,\u00a0\u00a0 with the occasional jump-scare\u00a0\nfrom a creepy, long-limbed baby. But art history is really about thinking\u00a0\ncritically by observing closely. It\u2019s the study of objects and\u00a0\nimages to understand the people,\u00a0\u00a0 places and time periods they come from. Art reflects different perspectives and stories\u00a0\u00a0 but also reveals the ideas that\u00a0\nconnect people across the world. And that three-letter word \u2014\u00a0\n\u201cart\u201d \u2014 holds some big ideas. It can include ancient cave paintings and pride\u00a0\nflags, state-funded monuments and street art,\u00a0\u00a0 works designed for function and\u00a0\nworks designed to ruffle feathers. And since art is subjective, what\u2019s\u00a0\na beautiful sculpture to one person,\u00a0\u00a0 might be the stuff of nightmares to another. Plus, ideas about what art is have\u00a0\nchanged\u2014and continue to change\u2014over time. Not all cultures think of art the same way, or\u00a0\neven have a word for \u201cart\u201d in their language. Like, the Lega people from what\u2019s now\u00a0\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo\u00a0\u00a0 have a category of objects called\u00a0\nmasengo, which roughly translates\u00a0\u00a0 to \u201cheavy things\u201d and refers to items\u00a0\nwith great significance or \u201cweight.\u201d As for you, when you hear \u201cart history,\u201d\u00a0\nyou might think of something like this. Whoops, sorry, I meant, this: The\u00a0\nwell-known Sistine Chapel ceiling,\u00a0\u00a0 painted by Michelangelo di\u00a0\nLodovico Buonarroti Simoni. No clue why we call him by his first name. But let\u2019s explore why that ceiling\u00a0\ncomes to mind when you think about art,\u00a0\u00a0 and why you\u2019ve heard of the guy who painted it. Let\u2019s go to the drawing board! The story of the Sistine Chapel doesn\u2019t\u00a0\nactually begin with Michelangelo,\u00a0\u00a0 but with a wealthy Italian\u00a0\nfamily called the Medicis. The Medicis ruled Florence and, later,\u00a0\nTuscany, from the 15th to the 18th centuries. They also controlled the what, where,\u00a0\nand how of the local art scene. They financially supported several\u00a0\nhuge artists\u2014including Michelangelo. So with the Medici Brand behind him, Michelangelo\u00a0\nwas basically one of Italy\u2019s biggest influencers. He even caught the eye of Pope Julius\u00a0\nthe Second, who commissioned him to\u00a0\u00a0 paint the now famous Sistine Chapel ceiling. Now, the Medicis were also sponsors of the\u00a0\npainter and architect Giorgio Vasari, who\u00a0\u00a0 wrote a book called \u201cLives of the Most Excellent\u00a0\nItalian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.\u201d It celebrated Michelangelo\u00a0\nand other artists like him,\u00a0\u00a0 and it gave the Medicis credit for\u00a0\nsupporting a historic, quote, \u201crebirth.\u201d In fact, before the French term \u201cRenaissance\u201d\u00a0\nbecame prominent in the 19th century,\u00a0\u00a0 Vasari described this artistic moment in time as\u00a0\n\u201crinascita\u201d\u2014 Italian for \u201crenewal\u201d or \u201crebirth.\u201d So yeah, the book was basically\u00a0\nsixteenth-century sponsored content,\u00a0\u00a0 and it became the bedrock of\u00a0\nwhat we know now as art history. It shaped not only the way\u00a0\nart history would be written,\u00a0\u00a0 but which artworks were considered important,\u00a0\ntalked about, and eventually meme-ified. Of course, writing about art\u00a0\ndidn\u2019t start with Vasari. By the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E.,\u00a0\nPlato was wrestling with art\u2019s imitation\u00a0\u00a0 of reality in his writings, and Aristotle\u00a0\nwas exploring how art can conjure emotions.

    "smry_text": "Biombo: A Folding Screen  \nJapanese design, dating back centuries, this biombo tells a story through its decorative elements. The screen's rich history is evident; it served as decor in a wealthy Spanish home during the late 17th century.\n\nThe Biombo as Symbol\nHistorical events like Spanish conquest of Tenochtitlan are often presented differently based on the primary source, artwork, or document examined.  Native accounts and records offer differing stories, highlighting the complexity of historical documentation. Learning about this biombo helps us understand the multifaceted nature of history itself. \n\nThe Craft of Interpreting the Past\nThis video explores art in connection with history, examining objects like the biombo as a tool to learn about different perspectives and narratives. Art represents cultural influences, ideas, and individual experiences. The discussion also expands on how art's interpretation varies across cultures, referencing indigenous classifications from modern Congo tribes.\n\nThe Subjectivity of Art\nArt holds power through varied mediums\u2014from ancient cave paintings to modern-day works. Art can evoke feelings, ignite inspiration, or inspire dissent, all depending on the viewer\u2019s perspective and personal experience. \n\nDefining Art Through Time\nArt, especially how we define it throughout history, has evolved across cultures, languages, and time periods. This evolution reflects cultural values, beliefs, and societal shifts impacting artistic definition, language, and interpretations. For example, the word \"art\" itself might seem ambiguous across different cultures as some may use alternative terms entirely for 'art'.\n\n\nThe Sistine Chapel: A Symbol of Renaissance\nThis video delves into the history of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, exploring how such famous artworks intersect with larger historical context to inspire and guide art historians. \n\nEarly Influences In Art History\nPrevalent in ancient cultures like Plato and Aristotle's writings about the nature of reality, artists long recognized and engaged with art as a form of expression aimed at mimicking aspects of the real world. Notably, Zhang Yanyuan's work from the ninth century \"Famous Paintings\" serves as testament to this enduring fascination for the power and essence of art in ancient times \n\nThe Evolution of Art History\nArt historians have been working for centuries to decipher, categorize, and share information about various historical artworks through the years. From the Renaissance period's Vasari's book \u201cLives of the Most Excellent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\u201d to contemporary scholars exploring the influence of art in society and culture\u2014the craft of researching and studying these works continues to evolve with each generation. \n",

    "smry_text": "### Crash Course Art History: Unveiling art's Past and Present\n\nThis introduction delves into the history of art through the lens of art history, exploring how objects tell stories. It aims to debunk popular misconceptions about the field. \n\n**The Purpose of Art History:** \n\nArt history transcends a dusty subject solely used for trivia nights.  Instead, it encourages critical observation and analysis, unveiling insights on historical context and people behind artworks.  Understanding different perspectives and narratives within art reveals underlying ideas across cultures and time periods. \n\n **Defining Art:** \nThe word \"art\" carries nuanced ideas, encompassing diverse expressions from ancient cave paintings to modern street art. Its subjective nature makes it a personal phenomenon, with each individual's interpretation shaping meaning. Additionally, the concept of what constitutes art has varied throughout time and cultures. Some may even question the existence of art, viewing any material representation as mere \"heavy things\" rather than a form of artistic expression. Examples provided are the Lega people's definition of \"masengo,\" which refers to objects of deep significance.  This demonstrates how cultural contexts shape understanding. \n\n**Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel:**\n The famous \"Sistine Chapel Ceiling painted by Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni\" exemplifies a significant artistic era, shaped by the Medici family's substantial influence over Italian artistry. This impactful artwork fueled a Renaissance period, where art flourished under patronage:\n   * **Origins of Art History:**  Instead of an abrupt start in the 5th century B.C.E., art history started with Plato and Aristotle who examined imitation of reality through works like \"Famous Paintings of Successive Dynasties\" written as early as the 9th century C.E and later developed by historian Zhang Yanyuan, the oldest comprehensive record of Chinese painting history to exist.   \n* **The Legacy of Vasari:** \n Giorgio Vasari's extensive biographies contributed significantly to shaping what we call art history today: \n    * His biographical series cemented its framework: artists and artworks deemed \"worthy\" were showcased prominently, becoming the cornerstone for Western-centric interpretations. \n    * While this canon evolved through centuries, Vasari\u2019s work created a template of art's development based on specific Western European examples.\n\n**Establishing Personal Artistic Canon:**\n The course invites viewers to challenge the established canon through Sarah Urist Green's own selection process, highlighting both historical figures and artworks that deeply resonate with her:\n\n\n* **The \"Canon Cannon\":**  This highlights different artistic periods and notable contributors across history to form a more balanced, personal overview.\n\n\n\nThrough these examples and discussions about art history, this course encourages a deeper understanding of its role in shaping our cultural perspective.\n",

He even caught the eye of Pope Julius\u00a0\nthe Second, who commissioned him to\u00a0\u00a0 paint the now famous Sistine Chapel ceiling. Now, the Medicis were also sponsors of the\u00a0\npainter and architect Giorgio Vasari, who\u00a0\u00a0 wrote a book called \u201cLives of the Most Excellent\u00a0\nItalian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.\u201d It celebrated Michelangelo\u00a0\nand other artists like him,\u00a0\u00a0 and it gave the Medicis credit for\u00a0\nsupporting a historic, quote, \u201crebirth.\u201d In fact, before the French term \u201cRenaissance\u201d\u00a0\nbecame prominent in the 19th century,\u00a0\u00a0 Vasari described this artistic moment in time as\u00a0\n\u201crinascita\u201d\u2014 Italian for \u201crenewal\u201d or \u201crebirth.\u201d So yeah, the book was basically\u00a0\nsixteenth-century sponsored content,\u00a0\u00a0 and it became the bedrock of\u00a0\nwhat we know now as art history.

So, there\u2019s evidence of art historical\u00a0\nwritings throughout the world,\u00a0\u00a0 and through much of recorded history. But Vasari\u2019s series of biographies strongly\u00a0\nshaped how the story of art would be told\u00a0\u00a0 from then on, with a significant\u00a0\nbias toward Western European art.

    "smry_text": "The story of the Sistine Chapel begins before Michelangelo, with the Medici family who wielded power over Florence and Tuscan art for centuries. The Medici financially supported prominent artists like Michelangelo.  They secured commissions and ensured his fame, making him one of Italy's most influential figures. \n\nOne individual significantly impacted the history of art was Giorgio Vasari, whose book \"Lives of the Most Excellent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\" shaped how art was documented. Though sponsored content, it became a defining text influencing how art is studied and considered historically important. Vasari's works influenced the formation of an artist-focused canon which remains influential today and can be viewed as having impacted how we understand art history.\n\nAs early as the 5th century B.C.E., philosophers like Plato wrestled with art imitation, prompting exploration by Aristotle regarding how art impacts emotions. Chinese artistic influence on world histories begins with Zhang Yanyuan's \"Famous Paintings of Successive Dynasties\". Across millennia, historical writings about art began to emerge globally.  Vasari\u2019s biography helped shape how these art-related narratives were told, highlighting Western European art. \n\nThe canon of art history, which identifies specific great artists as part of Western tradition and those who stand out based on artistic merit, became established by Vasari's influence. This concept has been both challenged and debated amongst art historians in the present day.  Art historian's work today requires us to look at multiple angles when exploring art and considers elements of race, class, and gender, which are vital in analyzing art\u2019s impact and significance. \n\nThrough analysis across diverse perspectives, these historical narratives help connect art history through cultural context. An contemporary example is Kara Walker's \"Fons Americanus,\" inspired by monuments showcasing British colonial influence in Africa and the Americas. This piece reflects on a differing narrative often missing in historic commemorations. \n\n\n\n",

    "smry_text": "Art history has roots in ancient traditions: scholars from Plato's time through Zhang Yanyuan's works all documented art. Vasari's biographies heavily influenced how art was studied until his 'sixteenth-century sponsored content,' creating a foundation for our understanding of art history. This led to the development of a \"canon,\" comprising artists and artworks considered truly great, with further contributions enriching it over time.\n\nA notable example is the canonization of \"Old Masters,\" artists whose work set a benchmark for succeeding generations. Over time, art history broadened its perspective, incorporating new masterpieces and challenging pre-established canon beliefs. Art criticism emerged as a dedicated area to explore how and why art is judged and interpreted. \n\n\nThe mid-twentieth century saw the crucial introduction of race, class, and gender as significant viewpoints through which to analyze art's production and reception. This multidisciplinary approach further reshaped the field of art history. Contemporary artists continue to challenge the limits of 'Western Art History,' pushing for a more inclusive perspective by exploring the untold stories embedded in their subjects.\n\nArtists have been able to bring forth diverse voices and perspectives, as exemplified by Kara Walker's \"Fons Americanus\". Her artwork confronts differing perceptions of history, challenging existing narratives that often depict colonial rule from a biased perspective. The study of art allows us to understand both its history as reflected in the subject matter itself and the limitations of our own perspectives.\n\nWe delve deeper into the canvas with examples such as Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's \"The Raft of the Medusa,\" an iconic artwork reflecting a real historical event. In 1816, a disastrous voyage led to widespread panic among French crew members who attempted self-preservation, leading to a dramatic escape in a doomed attempt for survival across multiple days at sea. The narrative surrounding this shipwreck serves as an example of historical narratives. It also underlines how art can encapsulate the stories behind forgotten and often misunderstood events that shape our understanding and perception of history itself.   \n",

When rescue finally arrived,\u00a0\nonly fifteen survivors remained,\u00a0\u00a0 with five more dying before ever seeing land.

He interviewed survivors of the\u00a0\nMedusa, drew their portraits,\u00a0\u00a0 and consulted a book that two of\u00a0\nthem wrote about what happened.

    "smry_text": "Art history is built upon written descriptions dating back to ancient times. Vasari's writings significantly influenced the trajectory of art history by highlighting Western European art with a bias towards those artists from the past and forming what we call the \"canon of art history\" \u2013  a collection of influential artistic masterpieces believed to advance art and be remembered in discussions about art. \n\nThe canon has evolved significantly over time, often influenced by changes in taste, new discoveries, and different understandings of art's value. A shift emerged from categorizing artists and artworks based on style and period, leading to the development of Art criticism during this period, focusing on examining the subject at hand.  Throughout the 20th century, social changes like race, class, and gender began contributing factors to art analysis as it provided new perspectives for discussing the process of making art.\n\n\nThe analysis of art allows for greater understanding not just how things are made but also how history itself is constructed. Studying materials helps expand these analyses by considering different perspectives on what's left behind, such as a work from the 18th century by Kara Walker called \"Fons Americanus,\" which challenges the historical narrative presented in the Victoria Memorial statue - offering an alternative and unsettling view of colonial rule, slavery and its lasting impact. This highlights that it is not only important to consider what is included, but also about which aspects are absent. A classic example is Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault' \"The Raft of the Medusa\" (1819) \u2014 a painting of a tragic tale involving a French ship in distress.  The story documented through sketches, drafts, and historical records allowed G\u00e9ricault to paint such an emotionally devastating piece of art, yet many interpretations occurred due to the controversial representation of the historical event involving the involvement of the French King. \n\nThere are cases where artwork survived for centuries \u2014 as was evident in this famous painting from 1819\u2013\"The Raft of the Medusa.\"  Sometimes, even the artists' working methods and responses can offer crucial insight to these materials\u2019 provenance. For example, materials often provide the history of an artwork \u2014 like our \u201cdrum,\u201d which remains a mystery about who made it when, is an illustration of the challenges in accessing art and preserving it over time.\n\n \n",

As Walker\u2019s work shows us, it\u2019s as important to\u00a0\nthink about what isn\u2019t included in art as what is. And the same goes for history. So, yeah, let\u2019s launch her right into the canon. And often, what is remembered comes\u00a0\ndown to what materials have survived. Take this painting: \u201cThe Raft of the Medusa,\u201d\u00a0\npainted by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault in 1819. It\u2019s a massive artwork that\u00a0\ntells an even bigger story. In 1816, a French ship set\u00a0\noff for the coast of Senegal,\u00a0\u00a0 captained by a pal of King Louis the 18th,\u00a0\nwho hadn\u2019t been at sea in twenty years. The results were disastrous: the captain wrecked\u00a0\nthe ship, which didn\u2019t have enough lifeboats,\u00a0\u00a0 so the crew cobbled together a raft\u00a0\nto carry the remaining passengers. About 150 people were set adrift on\u00a0\nthe makeshift vessel, and during the\u00a0\u00a0 next thirteen days at sea, they fought,\u00a0\nkilled, and even resorted to cannibalism. When rescue finally arrived,\u00a0\nonly fifteen survivors remained,\u00a0\u00a0 with five more dying before ever seeing land. It took G\u00e9ricault over a year to paint the scene,\u00a0\u00a0 which we know from documents that have survived:\u00a0\nsketches, drafts, and letters about his work. He interviewed survivors of the\u00a0\nMedusa, drew their portraits,\u00a0\u00a0 and consulted a book that two of\u00a0\nthem wrote about what happened. And he wrestled with how to paint it,\u00a0\u00a0 arranging the scene until he was\u00a0\nsatisfied with the story it would tell. We even know how the work\u00a0\nwas received by the public. At the time, opinions on the French monarchy\u00a0\nranged widely, so when G\u00e9ricault depicted\u00a0\u00a0 a tragedy caused by the king\u2019s incompetent\u00a0\nleadership, many interpreted that as a sick burn. The point is: We know so much\u00a0\nabout this one painting because\u00a0\u00a0 lots of material evidence about it has\u00a0\nsurvived the past two hundred years. But that\u2019s not the case for so many other works. Like this drum, which sits in the British Museum. We don\u2019t know exactly who made it or when. What little we know right\u00a0\nnow is from museum records,\u00a0\u00a0 which say an Irish scientist procured the\u00a0\ndrum in Virginia in the early 18th century. The museum labeled it an American\u00a0\nIndian drum made of a hollowed tree. Then, over 150 years later,\u00a0\u00a0 an anthropologist noticed it looked\u00a0\na lot like drums made in West Africa. But it took about seventy more years\u00a0\nbefore researchers figured out the\u00a0\u00a0 drum was made of wood from a\u00a0\nWest African species of tree. It\u2019s likely that someone from the Akan\u00a0\nculture, in what\u2019s now Ghana, made the drum. In its original context, it would have\u00a0\nbeen played as part of a whole ensemble. But at some point, the drum probably ended\u00a0\nup on a ship from Africa to North America. We have stacks of information to help\u00a0\nus understand \u201cThe Raft of the Medusa.\u201d But with the drum, we\u2019re piecing\u00a0\ntogether a story from scraps. Artifacts like these show\u00a0\nus how much what survives\u00a0\u00a0 our history shapes our understanding of it. But the flip side is also true: the\u00a0\nmore we uncover what\u2019s been lost,\u00a0\u00a0",

    "smry_text": "Many artists achieved legendary status, and were referenced by future generations as \"Old Masters\". Art history evolved to include new masterpieces and creators while forgetting others. \n\nThe categorization and analysis of artworks by style or time periods led to a formal field of art criticism. In the mid-20th century, racial, social class, and gender became recognized lenses for analyzing art's creation, including its audiences.  Scholars examine images and materials from multiple perspectives to gain more understanding about each other, themselves, and diverse cultures.\n\nArt provides insight into historical accounts being constructed as a product of their telling and the self-limited perspectives we all hold.   Through art history, studying these constructions allows us to better understand how culture shapes our view of the world. \n\n\nThe works of Kara Walker demonstrate an approach to understanding contrasting historical narrative. Her \"Fons Americanus\" (American Fountain), inspired by London\u2019s Victoria Memorial, presents a unique interpretation of colonial rule and oppression. Comparing traditional depictions with her work highlights the silenced stories of African history often overlooked in imperial narratives. Through art, exploring marginalized voices allows us to gain deeper understanding about these untold stories.\n\nThe Raft of the Medusa by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault serves as a key example for understanding how the surviving records can be used to analyze art's context and purpose. The painting was based on multiple sources of documentation provided by survivors. G\u00e9ricault's meticulous approach in depicting this historical scenario through art provides insight into his creative process, revealing aspects such as public reception at the time that reflect the political climate.  \n\nMaterial evidence plays a crucial role in understanding specific works while the lack thereof reveals the limitations of studying many artistic elements from a historical perspective (such as this drum found in the British Museum). Studying these limited artifacts like artifacts allows us to see how our current understanding is shaped by available information and understand its evolution.  By seeking out missing pieces of history, we continually revise our approach to reconstructing past events using evidence found.\n",

We\u2019ll raise juicy questions about\u00a0\nhow history is created and told,\u00a0\u00a0 how cultures swap ideas and materials, how artists\u00a0\nrespond to social issues, and so much more.

    "smry_text": "A speaker discusses the importance of recognizing perspective diversity in historical understanding, using examples from Kara Walker's art.  \n\n**Understanding Historical Perspectives:** \nWalker's \"Fons Americanus,\" inspired by London's Victoria Memorial, presents a different narrative of history than the British colonial period. This piece confronts audiences with previously overlooked aspects of colonialism, such as the human cost of European rule. Art often highlights those that are excluded in historical narratives and this approach highlights what is not included. \n**Influence of Surviving Materials:** \nWhen analyzing artworks, understanding their materials' survival becomes key. Such survival helps illuminate stories behind famous works of art like Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's \"The Raft of the Medusa.\" This painting, based on documented research from surviving sketches and accounts of events by survivors, unveils a real-life tragedy during French maritime disaster. \n**Materials in Museums & Understanding Cultural History:**  \nExamples include the drum found at the British Museum but information is limited about its origin.  Through this type of investigation, researchers have learned about objects like the \"American Indian\" drum that was actually created by an Akan culture member from West Africa. This demonstrates how the material landscape is important to understanding our artistic history and cultural connections between different continents.\n**The Power of Art:** \nArtists reflect on social issues and use various mediums in expressing viewpoints, often uncovering new stories through art.  By studying art history, as they discuss in this Crash Course episode, viewers can analyze perspectives while exploring the interconnectivity of events over time and across cultures. \n\n **Next Episode:** \nThe speaker highlights what is covered next to help viewers understand that by closely viewing art pieces, new answers may be uncovered about its meaning beyond surface-level thoughts. They encourage supporters who want to support their work to consider joining the Patreon community for continued access. \n",
